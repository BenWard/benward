Much is being written today about the [apparently inevitable](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/may/19/yahoo-poised-buy-tumblr) acquisition of [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) by [Yahoo](http://yahoo.com). Much of much that is being written consists of joking-not-joking about when the [Archive Team](http://archiveteam.org) should start mirroring the service to get a head start on their deletion, and other playful-but-deadly-serious snark at the obvious and somewhat reasonable ‘Geocities 2.0’ narrative.

I worked for Yahoo when Geocities died, and I wrote a lengthy email plea to then CEO Carol Bartz that we should aid in its archiving (I'm sure I wasn't alone in doing so.) To her credit, she responded positively and (perhaps consequently, perhaps coincidentally) Yahoo did add a feature for people to download their own sites. Yet we all know that was insufficient to save that internet history, especially on a network that was predominantly abandoned by its users for so many years.

I share a lot of the attitudes of [Jason Scott](http://ascii.textfiles.com) and [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com) toward archiving the web. I share in the desperate desire that we do it, I share in the frustration when we fail, and I detest as much as anyone I know the weasel words ‘sunsetting’ and other such indirection.

I also think that in the easy satisfaction of venting toward large companies and the genuinely needed publicity that generates around internet archiving, we're fighting against something inevitable.

## Everybody dies.

We can try very, very hard to live by the mantra that [Cool URIs don't change](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html). We implement redirects, and for the lifetime of our sites it's viable. But there's a disconnect between the expectation of ongoing maintenance of URLs, and the actual viability of a service doing so after a product ceases to be commercially viable.

In the best case you have services like Tumblr and Posterous, where users could use your own domain with the service. Eventually I'll import my Posterous posts onto benward.me and write some redirect magic in nginx to have [posts.benward.me](posts.benward.me) take you to roughly the right place. Likewise Tumblr (which I've been halfway through migrating for six months, so when that moves it's not because of Yahoo, FYI.)

Most users do not use their own domain, or take their own backups. So, when Twitter shutters Posterous, or Six Apart close Pownce, are those companies obligated to maintain a server to point those `user.example.com` URLs pointing to new homes or [Archive.org](http://archive.org) mirrors? What about after [SAYmedia](http://www.saymedia.com) bought Six Apart's assets? What about the next owner after that? You could argue they should; it wouldn't be the most expensive piece of infrastructure running at Twitter, certainly. But still, extrapolate: Companies have boards and shareholders and ([B-Corporations](http://www.bcorporation.net) notwithstanding) they have a primary, legally enforceable responsibility to deliver maximal shareholder value and so not spend money unnecessarily.

Services also have genuine quandaries with regard to data ownership, and expectations of control on behalf of those users. Transferring a database, even of published content, of a user's data to a third party is legally non-trivial, if not impermissible.

If you were starting a new service today you could try to preempt this by including clauses in your <abbr title="Terms of Service">ToS</abbr> promising the transfer of public content to an archive (or decentralised bundle via BitTorrent) in the event of closure, which could serve as consent from the user and obligation on the part of future owners. But that's not services today, and it won't be all services in the future either.

What happens when those companies genuinely go bust? Their assets in the hands of liquidators. Who is obliged to run that server, and pay [ICANN](http://www.icann.org) for the domain renewal?

How do those obligations apply to personal sites? I spend $20 per domain every few years to maintain my registrations of `ben-ward.co.uk`, `ben-ward.com`, and `bnwrd.me`. If I ever get that `benward.com` domain I'll be renewing five domains, pretty much out of pedantic principal. How lucky for me, living a comfortable life where dropping $60+ dollars on domain renewals is a comfortable privilege. It's certainly not a frugal use of my money. More people around the world are struggling to use that sum to feed their family for a fortnight and have nothing left over.

A great success of Tumblr, Twitter, MySpace, Facebook et al is a generation of tools embraced by ever broader cross-sections of international society, and the ad-supported models that fund them have enabled internet publishing to move beyond the privilege of the somewhat-rich.

## The archiving of this increasingly diverse web must not be an indulgence of affluent middle classes.

[The Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php) exists as a quite excellent tool for researching the history of the web, but it is not integrated with the natural usage of the web. When domains die, their fate is slow decline: Incompatible redirects (`photos.yahoo.com` to `flickr.com`) and catch-all closure pages ([Geocities](http://geocities.yahoo.com/index.php)) will eventually all be squatted over by SEO shitbathers.

We need to concede that though we can maintain the paths of URIs over the lifetime of a service, most domain names are unavoidably ephemeral. A two year registration to host a joke, a fifteen year registration to build a company. All will eventually be resold.

So what should we do? We need to not fight the ephemerality. We need to look at the very heart of the web, the directory that connects the names of our services to the servers they run on, and we need to apply the concept of the Wayback Machine to it. We need temporal DNS, maintained by librarians to keep the domains of the past connected to their archived futures. Your DNS provider as Time Lord*; rather than telling you what Geocities was like, picking a date at the DNS level could route all of your internet traffic to 1998.

Search engines would crawl this archived web in parallel to the live data, month by month. Your search results annotated ‘geocities.com, circa 2004’, then you could set the dial and go.

<aside>There are other interesting hacks we could throw in to make this stuff addressable on a site-by-site basis, too. <code>http+2005-02-09://ben-ward.co.uk</code>?</aside>

I think I'm proposing that we break DNS to save the web. Which has a gazillion repercussions, not least is a dependency on responsible DNS Libraries who could maintain a legacy record to `geocities.yahoo.com` for as long as the service is numb but somehow handle the duality when Tumblr gets rebranded (Note: JOKE.)

We already are putting most of that trust in a single entity: Archive.org. If we put the capabilities of the Wayback Machine lower down the hierarchy of web infrastructure, we could facilitate the creation and interoperability of multiple Great Libraries. I think we should move from archiving being a desperate exercise in saving content, to archives and snapshots being a native piece of the platform.

Meanwhile, we can continue to do the best with what we have, and you can help by running Archive Team's [Warrior appliance](http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=ArchiveTeam_Warrior)  on any spare machines you have.
