iTunes 10—and I don't know for sure if this is a new feature—now offers an exciting new menu option: <kbd class="menu">Choose Photos to Share…</kbd>. Then you get an interface to pick photographs to share over your local network through something called ‘Home Sharing’. It reminds me of Windows Vista, except that to Microsoft's credit, this was a feature of their operating system, not of their _media player_.

Someone needs to tighten the iTunes team's leash, soon.
