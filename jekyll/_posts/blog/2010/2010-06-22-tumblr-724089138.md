Sound good to you?

## Addenda

* This was on a `tiff` file. If I try Open With… on this actual screenshot it's even worse, with every single version of Opera for the past decade offered up as a contender.
* You can force Finder to clear out *old, dead, deleted* apps from the list by deleting `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist` and then restarting Finder. It will repopulate the menu from scratch. Which doesn't help if you actually do have all these apps installed.
* If you find one of the offending apps, right click, Show Package Contents choose ‘Contents’ and then edit `Info.plist` you can remove document type associations from certain apps. That will work for the archived browsers that will never get updated, but will be overridden by app updates from anything current that you're just not interested in. Also, I tried this, restarted Finder again and it didn't actually work.
