Hello, dear reader.

I'm slowly getting around to consolidating what I write online. Writing on Tumblr has been a good experience, and using it I've learned to write regularly again. There's a hard to describe allure to the Tumblr Dashboard, which I still use from time to time even though [Fever](http://feedafever.com) is a great feed reader… perhaps it's because Tumblr's RSS output is a bit shit?

Anyway. I'm fragmented. I'm trying to move most of my writing back to [my own domain](http://benward.me), where I control the experience and own the data. This means, at some point, [merging](http://github.com/benward/http://github.com/BenWard/tumblr2wordpress/) content from here back to there, and it would mean that unless I do something to bridge it, I'll stop posting to Tumblr. Would that matter? If I posted on Tumblr tomorrow that I was blogging somewhere else and that you should subscribe to a feed instead would you? Or do read what I write here precisely because it is on Tumblr? Did you actually discover it through Tumblr?

I perceive Tumblr as an askew, insular tool, that happens to also function as a regular blogging platform as well. It has a healthy, quite witty community of users that seem to interact only through Tumblr, holding discussions through reblogging, but I see that as limiting discussions to Tumblr, rather than inclusively across the net as a whole. There's a disconnect between the at of reblogging a fellow Tumblr user and posting a quote from some other blog on the internet.

Is my perception off? Is my open-web centricity skewing my judgement of this network?  Is it actually the case that none of you would read my posts if it was just a blog on ‘the internet’ rather than ‘on Tumblr’?

Will you follow me there? Would you miss me if I'm gone?
