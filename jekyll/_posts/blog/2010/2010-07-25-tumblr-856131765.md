> It is, overall, a misleading representation of FourSquare to the readership of the Guardian. But to rip into the piece would be wrong, because although much of detail and attribution of functionality is fuzzy (or wrong), the social problem that the article describes is absolutely real, to the point that it doesn’t matter that FourSquare as an application isn’t the precise cause.

<cite><a href="http://benward.me/blog/concerning-foursquare">Concerning FourSquare</a></cite>, by me.

In response to Leo Hickman's deeply flawed [How I became a FourSquare cyberstalker](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jul/23/foursquare), I went on a bit of a brain dump about the article, FourSquare and how I think services in general could actively discourage the stalking scenarios that article refers to, and evade badly misinformed press coverage for good measure with active communication of anti-patterns integrated into their applications.
