[Last.FM](http://last.fm)'s [events](http://last.fm/events) feature is a little undercooked and buried, I regret, but the functionality is an absolute gem when you get into it. Events, filtered by your music listening habits, and notification delivered to you via a feed as soon as it hits the Last.FM database. The exposure for events you're attending, and what your friends are up to though is a little unrealized ([here's my event page](http://last.fm/user/benward/events)), and the standard gig pages are pretty simple, but today I discovered that _festivals_ have their own special mode.

Festival line ups sorted into headliners based on your personal listening habits, and an overall compatibility rating for the entire event. Absolutely shit hot.

(Based on this, looks like I'll be buying tickets for [Treasure Island](http://www.treasureislandfestival.com/), too.)
