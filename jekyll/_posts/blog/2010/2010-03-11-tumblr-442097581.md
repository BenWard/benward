For a fairly long time now, browsers have been configured not to allow third-party domains (or, to use their real name "advertisers") to set tracking cookies on computers via embedded advertising. Now, in the age of (kinda crappy, JavaScript-dependent) comment widgets like [Disqus](http://disqus.com), it is apparently acceptable to provide blanket instructions to users on how to undo that small step forward in sane privacy settings, because it's inconvenient for a single piece of their functionality.

That final paragraph about adding Discus as an exception to the blocked cookies setting should be the *only* paragraph. The rest of it is up there with ‘Hey, just disable your virus scanner’ in terms of lazy idiocy, and to present the entire scenario as an **error** (red highlight, ‘warning’ language) is completely disingenuous.

If you're a third party widget of any kind who needs this kind of non-standard, much-abused functionality, you should be *asking* for permission, not telling the poor user that their system is at fault when it's not.
