Checkboxes, bitches.

* When you create an app, it should declare which permissions it actually requires to function (disabled, ticked checkbox) and which it desires by default (ticked checkbox.)
* Everything not required is optional/user definable.
* Permission to posting a tweet is separate from other, private profile writing operations, since it's so socially destructive.
* Apps would never be allowed to _require_ posting permission (if denied, they fall back to generating a URL the user can use to manually post through the Twitter website.)
* I think this also makes the permissions/capabilities copy clearer. Bonus.

Edit/Update: A little [discussion between OAuth contributors broke out on Buzz](http://www.google.com/buzz/tantek/5YHAAmztLcD) in response to this.
