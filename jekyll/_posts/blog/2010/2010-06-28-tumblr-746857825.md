> SHUT. the fuck UP. about HIPSTERS. shut the fuck up forever about them. they are not even real. they are just regular dudes and ladies with a certain aesthetic and maybe a certain taste in music, just like you and your friends. shut the fuck up about triangles, beards, and irony. you created them. shut the fuck up about hipsters now and tomorrow check again to be sure you have remained shut (the fuck) up. shut the fuck up about buzz bands. clean-shaven dudes in polos like them just as much as hirsute ones in flannel. if you have ever said “ugh there are so many hipsters here” you literally deserve to be murdered. small-town Iowa has dudes who like obscure things too. shut the fuck up about hipsters.
