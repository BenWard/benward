*[Google, Verizon and an "Open Internet" from a Mobile perspective - pinch/zoom blog](http://blog.pinchzoom.com/post/932982866/open-internet)*

Brian Fling provides some authoritative analysis of the Google-Verizon proposal, exploring the wireless technical constraint that could make net neutrality unworkable. It's a very good read, well reasoned and worthy of consideration, but my overall feeling is that this sort of information and interpretation should be something that Google explicitly explains and justifies in their summary release.
