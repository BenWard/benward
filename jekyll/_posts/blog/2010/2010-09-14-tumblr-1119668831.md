Best _dressed_ too. That brown shirt/tan tie thing turned out much better than I expected when I went digging for clean, uncreased clothes after vacation.

Furthermore, this was taken as I was _twirling_ that picture frame in my hands like some kind of cool-as-ice… art dealer… I suppose. Forget it.

Furthermore, look at my _tan_.

But mostly, look at at [Ian](http://slumbrparty.com), [Timoni](http://timoni.org) and [Jeff](http://progrium.com) for hosting an Epic Birthday celebration true to its name. Between this and the Nth Annual Ben Party, we've developed a bonafide summer party season in San Francisco. You should come visit next year; we'll rock your world, and Lordy knows how good we'll look doing it.
