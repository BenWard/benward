> Personally I’m surprised it wasn’t put down sooner. There was some innovative stuff in Wave, but when a service that is ‘designed to replace email’ gains an email notifier to help people keep up with what’s happening in their Wave, you’ve got to question what the service’s actual purpose is.

When I heard the [news](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/update-on-google-wave.html) of Wave getting closed down, I had an immediate speel about why it so obviously failed, but Nik nails it better. As far as I'm concerned, the features of the Wave UI should have been progressive enhancement of hyperlinks in messages.
