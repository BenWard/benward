Flickr's people tagging feature has interesting restrictions on who you can/can't tag in other people's photographs, depending on other privacy settings. The UI approach is smart, in that when you run into it you get a decent explanation. Although, I am starting to find that I no-longer have a firm grasp on what Flickr does and doesn't permit me to do in different situations, not to mention whether (and where) this stuff is configurable.
