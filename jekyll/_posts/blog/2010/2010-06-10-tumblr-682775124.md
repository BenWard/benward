Please forgive me, but I'm going to be an unrelenting bitch about this Google background thing for just a moment longer:

When you *eventually* figure out how to get a white background back on Google.com (once the background picker tool eventually loads—it will probably force you to log in again first—look under ‘Editors Picks’, and then ‘White’) you may notice a few things:

1. On a white background, the text is still white, so you'll be reading everything by shadow shape. Users of Microsoft Internet Explorer (which has shitty support for `text-shadow`) are screwed ([screenshot](http://skitch.com/benward/d8tpa).)
2. ‘White’—which you and I and everyone else would just consider a colour—is in fact still served up by Google as an *image*.
3. That image is named ‘White-2000×1500’.
4. Sounds large, right? Don't panic, the actual image dimensions are 1600×1200.
5. Which is still an extra HTTP request and 11KB over the wire.
6. And it's loaded as an `<img>` element, rather than a background image.
7. And that `<img>` doesn't have any alt text, so screen readers are going to try and infer what it might mean. Like, they're going to read out: "http://lh6.ggpht.com/_fxkujw2mA9U/TA79kGonjWI/AAAAAAAAAO8/wgt1U7ogm0k/e365/white-2000x1500.jpg".

Where was [Steve Sounders](http://stevesouders.com/) when they shit this one out?

Who implements background customization with only support for images anyway?

What‽
