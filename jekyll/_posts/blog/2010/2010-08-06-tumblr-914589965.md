I quite dislike how iPhone Carcassonne makes it so self-explanatory to dick people over. I think that letting you reference the tile sheet for remaining tiles is one thing, but showing blocked off squares _before you even commit your tile_ just makes it a bit too easy. It certainly changes the style of the game from the regular table version.
