As documented here, I'm a very happy user of the self-hosted [Feverº](http://feedafever.com) feed reader by Shaun Inman. I moved away from Google Reader it brings me out in a rash, but last week I clicked something by mistake and ended up on my old Reader front page. Apparently, this is what it looks like now.

I'm aware that with the Reader API, there are a plethora of third party clients for Google Reader now, providing iPhone and Mac OSX native apps for reading the feeds that Google cache for you. Given that, does anyone still use Google's interface? _How_?

(Also: “Browse for stuff”? _Really_?)
