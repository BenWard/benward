Via [Edgar Wright](http://www.edgarwrighthere.com)'s excellent documentation of the soundtrack for [the new Scott Pilgrim trailer](http://www.edgarwrighthere.com/2010/06/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-international-trailer) I totally discovered Blood Red Shoes this week. This is from their first record, which still isn't available natively in the US. Even on iTunes.

Utter hotness.
