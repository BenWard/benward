The UK General Election is going to be on May 6th 2010, so if you're a fellow expat (or even if you're not), please ensure you're [registered to vote](http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/).

What with the [digital economy bill](http://www.openrightsgroup.org/campaigns/disconnection), and the Tories [Murdochian, anti-BBC media policy](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8601711.stm),Â there's some serious cultural damage to fight against.

For expats, if you register a postal vote, your contribution will likely be counted only in the event of a close result, or you can arrange a proxy vote via a friend back home if you want to ensure you're counted on the night.
