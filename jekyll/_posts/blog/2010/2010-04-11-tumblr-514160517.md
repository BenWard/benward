> If you feel the need to surround yourself with stuff, at the very least make it stuff that you love. Keep it because it appeals to you, not because everyone else has one. To be surrounded by beautiful things - whether it's a view of the hills, or your back garden, paintings, ornaments, plants or pure nothingness - is a luxury that makes life worth the bother. Remembering to stop and look at them is entirely up to us.

What's the name for the relative that's married to your cousin? I don't know, and I'm writing from my iPhone, so I don't have the patience to trawl wikipedia and find out. Whatever, Sarah is married to my cousin. Which must have a name. Cousin-in-law?Not sure.

To the point. Yesterday I spent quite a bit of time writing about the art and objects and beautiful things I've started to acquire since I moved to the US. (No hyperlink.) Today Sarah writes this. What a wonderful collision of intense feelings for objects and beauty. You should read the whole post, as she's undertaking the incredible task of shedding 50% of all these objects and trinkets and ‘things’ over the course of the year.
