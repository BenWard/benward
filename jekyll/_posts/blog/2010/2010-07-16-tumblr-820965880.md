> As you would expect from a company focused on connecting people, we prioritize antenna performance over physical design if they are ever in conflict.

<cite>—<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/16/nokia-we-prioritize-antenna-performance-over-physical-design-i/">Nokia: ‘we prioritize antenna performance over physical design if they are ever in conflict’ — Engadget</a></cite>

Torn between: “That's great, really fantastic, Nokia. So where can I order your Smartphone that's actually competitive with any other feature of the iPhone? Or even the _old_ iPhone? Oh, you have one? It's in your car? Sure I'll just wait here whilst you go and get it. Why are you in such a hurry?”

Or, alternatively: “I'm confused. Your statement is supposed to emphasise that your decades of experience in cellular technologies makes for fantastic antennae, but I've also seen the design of your phones and can only conclude that you've had to prioritise a Napoleonic performance conflict.”
