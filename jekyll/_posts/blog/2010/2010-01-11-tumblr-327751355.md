##[River of Brakelights - Julian Casablancas](http://www.last.fm/music/Julian+Casablancas/_/River+of+Brakelights)

Got given a copy of The Strokes frontman's record over Christmas. In part, it does a good line in the neither-here-nor-there, ambling and non-descript that the last Strokes album suffered from, but it also contains a couple of absolute gems, and for that I will give the man immense credit.

I'm in obsession over the bridge and chorus for this, ‘River of Brakelights’, and the word juggling lyrics are shamelessly fun.
