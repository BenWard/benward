> In my family we think laughing is good. My parents raised me to have a sense of humor and to live a normal life. My mother did not carry me around under her arm like a loaf of French bread the way former Governor Palin carries her son Trig around looking for sympathy and votes.

Andrea Fay Friedman—an actress with Down syndrome—voiced a character with the same condition in Family Guy. There was a gag about being the daughter of the former Governor of Alaska. Sarah Palin continued her selective indignation about retard jokes on Facebook, roping in one of her other daughters to write about how offensive it all is.

> The show that mocked her baby brother, Trig (and/or others with special needs), in an episode yesterday.

And:

> People with special needs face challenges that many of us will never confront, and yet they are some of the kindest and most loving people you’ll ever meet. Their lives are difficult enough as it is, so why would anyone want to make their lives more difficult by mocking them?

Thing is, the Ellen character in Family Guy? That character is strong, capable, smart and a total fucking bitch; just like anyone. Her condition is not played for laughs, it's not a gag, it just ‘is’. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what to do when we're finding messages of social progress in episodes of Family Guy, but then I'm not the one who freaked out about it without watching the show.

In short Bristol and Sarah are both Palins.

Also, Family Guy isn't very funny, so save yourself the trouble with that.
