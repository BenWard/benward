There's no oath-ridden rant. No expansion about how upsettingly bad this is, on however many levels. I don't think we need to read it. We all know what this is.

I'm just going to sigh, and link you to [DavMail](http://davmail.sourceforge.net/), a nifty proxy that runs on your machine and translates Microsoft Exchange into IMAP, CalDAV, and other open standards, allowing those of us in non-Snow Leopard, non-Exchange 2007 corporate environments to use iCal, Mail and Address Book rather than any of this shit, present or future.

I worry that we still don't have anyone offering a serious alternative Mail client for Mac OSX. Apple's Mail.app is fine. Mostly. But lack of competition for vital, always-on infrastructure apps like Mail—especially in a world where Apple are focused more and more on the iPhone OS—could became a real frustration on OSX.
