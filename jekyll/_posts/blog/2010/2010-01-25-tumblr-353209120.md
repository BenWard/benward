*[Filibuster 2.0: How 41 Senators Control The Country Without Actually Filibustering](http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/01/filibuster-20-how-41-senators-control-the-country-without-actually-filibustering.php?ref=fpa)*

TPM's historical overview of the Senate filibuster rules, allowing a block-voting, power-at-all-costs opposition party to grind America to an embarrassing standstill. Glad of this, since in the years following my A-Levels I'd forgotten how it worked. (I think my brain rejected the knowledge because it was too stupid to be real.)

In a black-humoured twist to the practice of political hyperbole, people are _actually_ dying because of this. But apparently that's a cost worth paying if it means the Republicans take back the Presidency and Congressional majorities in 2012. _Then_ they'll stop being the petulant, trollish “Party of No”, and will instead embrace a true, democratic remit to do absolutely nothing about it.
