> People <em>love narratives</em>. They go to the movies to indulge in someone else’s narrative, they read books to shoot narratives straight into their bloodstream. People like narratives because <em>narratives are the lies they’re allowed to believe</em>. So we need to stop saying that the Republicans deal in narrative. We need to be honest. We need to tell people that they deal in lies.
