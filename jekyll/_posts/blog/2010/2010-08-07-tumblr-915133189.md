> Treats is the album iPod speakers are warned about as children, a ghostly camp fire tale to the eardrums, tinnitus's backward cousin from across the pond. Mastered at a level surely pushing the boundaries of legality, on first listen it seems less an album and more an elaborate prank to make the listener jump when a track appears on shuffle.
