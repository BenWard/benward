I hated the media-creep of iTunes from the start. A dedicated ‘QuickTime Video Library’ would've been my preferred solution for Movies and TV shows, a rebuild of iSync to handle MobileMe and iPhone synchronization settings, and a standalone iTunes Store app (or, frankly, web site) for media purchases. Everything interlinking and sharing content and interfaces where appropriate, of course, but none of this bullshit, where we are now shoehorning _books_ into ID3 tags… with an extra tab for shoehorning video metadata onto ID3 tags that I guess you're just supposed to ignore. Utter bullshit.

iTunes is the least Apple-like app of them all, and yet it's the hub of everything that defines the company.
