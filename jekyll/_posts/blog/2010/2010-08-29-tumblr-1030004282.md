> We used to wait for it  
> Now we're screaming  
> Sing the chorus again  

The penultimate refrain from Arcade Fire's "We Used To Wait". Quoted not for depth or meaning or lyrical intrigue or anything at all except that reading it will immediately pop that bit of the song into my head. Might be my favourite moment on the whole record.
