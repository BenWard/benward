Very cool in itself, but I think this is also a huge instant reward to Apple for launching the iPad with iWork. They gave over substatial presentation time to highlight the iPad's capability for productivity and business software, that it goes beyond media and consumer applications that the iPhone is focused on. Without iWork, iPad would be a similar, consumer, media device. With iWork, it's a computer. It was a very smart exercise in resetting expectations.
