> I'm surrounded by things. Loads of ‘things’. Art on my walls (Jon Burgerman, Pete Fowler, lots of screenprints), vinyl records and books in a slim bookcase by the wall, some toys balanced on top of that, a stack of board games (and a preference for the oldest editions I can find), plus the first set of ‘Sinfest’ webcomic books spread over a coffee table (I'd like other people to pick them up and start reading.) There are two guitars and a mandolin in the corner. In so far as I do, I love being in possession of these things. But I could do without all of them, individually. They are all beautiful objects, that's their value. But so long as I've got one aesthetic something near me that makes me smile, I'll suffice.

Following up the previous post, a copy of that thing I wrote somewhere else about objects.
