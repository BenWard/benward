> Well, yeah, of course it's extreme. You don't know anything about the individual. He could have had other issues, certainly. No one likes paying taxes, obviously.

<cite>Scott Brown (<abbr title="Repubican">R</abbr>-Mass)</cite>

Viva la difference. Apparently the occupation of ‘[terrorist suicide bomber flying an aeroplane into a building](http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/02/crash_pilot_wrote_anti-irs_anti-corporate_screed.php?ref=fpb)’ provokes sympathy and calm, psychological consideration if you just do it in the name of Republican economics.

Self parody is long gone. This is genuinely tragic.
