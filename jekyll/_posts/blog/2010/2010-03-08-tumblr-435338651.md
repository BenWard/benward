You hear a song, quiet on the radio, underneath somebody's conversation. You don't know this new song, but it helps you to remember two bars of another, different song. You desperately want to hear this second song, but you don't recall anything but those two bars (which are now repeating over and over in your head.) You want to hear that song, but you can't, because the song that's playing isn't that song.

It's been 24 hours since I couldn't remember the name of that song.
