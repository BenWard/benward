All-around lovely friend of mine Anna Pickard has never watched Lost, and so is watching all of Lost in a week before the final season starts. She's producing an episode guide as she goes. It has illustrations, and poems that rhyme.

These pages are already ranking as one of the most wonderfully entertaining things to exist on the internet.

(Full disclosure: I have never watched a season of Lost.)
