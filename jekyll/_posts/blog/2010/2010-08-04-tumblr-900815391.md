[The Incident](http://bigbucketsoftware.com/theincident/), “a fast-paced, retro-style action game for iPhone. Produced by Matt Comi and Nevan Mrgan”.

This interpretation of the pixelated protagonist rocks my world. (Downloadable as a wallpaper in various sizes.) Very excited for the imminent release of the game, too.
