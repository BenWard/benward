> If Twitter want a consistent user experience across platforms, that's good and that's their right. If Twitter wants the business security of owning their own app, and not being totally dependent on third parties, that's good and that's their right. But there is absolutely no justification for them being so damn cold about it.

Last paragraph to my own comment on <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8601-13577_3-20002202.html?communityId=2072&targetCommunityId=2072&blogId=36&tag=mncol">Comments on: Et tu, Twitter? Here comes developer ire</a>, concerning the revulsive way in which Twitter communicates with the outside world. They buy an iPhone client, announce that they'll be taking the market as their own with no charge and official branding, and then don't even say ‘thank you’ to the other developers that have driven the competition between iPhone clients for the past three years? Not cool.
