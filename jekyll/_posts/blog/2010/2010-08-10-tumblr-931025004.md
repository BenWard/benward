> It is reassuring to hear that the foxes are guarding the henhouse so diligently.

I've regarded ‘Don't be Evil’ as mantric bullshit forever, so the hysteria that this is somehow Google's twoface moment doesn't concern me in the slightest. They've been dicks like every other company for ages (resolving copyright issues in court for them and them alone, not supporting open standards in Android, to name two.) What's more, I also think it might be entirely reasonable to propose that wireless infrastructure needs temporary special treatment to be developed, given the United State's legacy infrastructure problem. Which means that in theory, Google's compromise proposal for limited net neutrality and regulation might be based in necessity.

Unfortunately, I'm sat here with what pretty much amounts to a huge ‘citation needed’ frown. If there's scientific and engineering merit to their compromise, they've dropped the ball by not stating up front what it is. All that's left is shady dealing and openwashing.
