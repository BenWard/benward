I seem to reference [Fever°](http://feedafever.com) every day at the moment (usually in the context of reading Tumblr…), but this evening I was hacking in aid of a different service; Twitter.

Fever has fabulous highlights feature called ‘Hot’, an aggregate view of articles and sites blogs you are subscribed to are linking to. The output is a ranked list of the most talked about things on the internet, sourced exclusively from people that you are already interested in. Fever goes further, allowing you to subscribe to feeds but keep them hidden as ‘Sparks’ (regular, visible feeds are ‘Kindling’.) So, whilst I don't read high-volume feeds like Engadget or Hacker News, I do subscribe to the feeds, so that when someone links to them, or they link to an interesting article of the day, the particular post will surface.

My most valuable sources are friends and colleagues. I subscribe to my [Delicious Network](http://delicious.com/network/BenWard); everything that you bookmark contributes to my reading highlights. Forever I wanted to add Twitter to this as well, but Twitter's RSS feed is both high volume, and doesn't mark up its links with HTML anchors; Fever doesn't see the links…

Today's hack fixes that. [TimelineLinks](http://github.com/benward/timelinelinks) grabs posts from the Twitter API (including retweets), only returns the posts containing links. It's rough around the edges, but it works well enough. I have it subscribed to in my Sparks. Tomorrow will be interesting, to see how it affects the highlight view.
