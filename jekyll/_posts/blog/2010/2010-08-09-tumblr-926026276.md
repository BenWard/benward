> Imagine”, sang John Lennon. “All the people”, he's rumoured to have continued. _All_ of them? Really? Can _you_ imagine all the people? Of course not. There are people living in parts of the Brazilian rainforest that no-one has even found yet. How could you possibly imagine something that no-one else has seen? Are you some kind of imagination super-man? Of course, you are not.

It having been two years, I've just written an epic new invitation to another party (my place in a few weeks. Invitation is private and on Facebook this year, so [befriend me](http://www.facebook.com/bnwrd) if you haven't heard.)

Anyway, as follows the pattern of the past few years, I had _far too much_ fun writing it. (But I've preemptively integrated a tl;dr joke, so it's fine.) Can you imagine when I get married? That girl's gonna need tolerance. Three-part novelization, totally. And the way things are going, I've got the free time to write it. That last sentence is deeply sadder than I intended, sorry. Everything's fine. I digress…

Michael prompted me to look up all of the previous invitation efforts. The first couple are clumsy, but this is from last year's First Annual Ben Party and I had totally forgotten it. I hope it's not too pompous to rather enjoy re-reading after 12 months. I know you're not supposed to laugh at your own jokes. Or blog about them, I guess.

Also, try reading it in Isaiah Mustafa's voice.
