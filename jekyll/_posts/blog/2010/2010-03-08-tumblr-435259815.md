> The States seem to have an aversion to products with “blood” in their name. I have to go out of my way to buy German Blutwurst, for example. Fortunately the British are so traditional that they wrap around and become progressive, offering these delicious breakfast cakes. I enjoy them much more than bacon or sausages.
