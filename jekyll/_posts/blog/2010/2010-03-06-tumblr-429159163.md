Woah, it's like you took two of my favourite things in the world and combined them; [latt√©sque 10" vinyl](http://vinylography.paperandplastick.com/bands/coffeeproject.html). (The band [Coffee Project](http://www.myspace.com/coffeeproject) are on MySpace. Not something I'm fussed by, alas, else I'd be all over this.)
