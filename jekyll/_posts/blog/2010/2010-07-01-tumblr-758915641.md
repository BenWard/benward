The New York Post—they of the infamous ‘USA Wins 1-1’ headline—signs off for the World Cup with the same ‘reinforce everything English people grow up thinking about Americans’ style they started with.

And yes, I do know that ‘USA wins…’ was a [reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Beats_Yale_29-29) to [Harvard-Yale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard-Yale_football_rivalry). I'll posit that use of an Ivy League in-joke as an international news headline reinforces ‘everything people grow up thinking about Americans.’ But of course, I'm only joking.
