There's a [new Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002Y27P3M). Looks quite nice, much improved $130 pricetag. Still features that inexplicably prominent keyboard, though. For a device that replaces books, I maintain they could comfortably make it a little thicker if it allowed the keyboard to slide away underneath. It would improve the device for the 99% of the time that you don't need a keyboard because you're _reading_.
