> Holland slating [referee] Howard Webb is like having a go at a policeman who books you for speeding when he could've done you for drink driving.

With the benefit of a day's retrospect, I've reassessed the Dutch performance from “disappointingly dirty” to “a bit of a disgrace.” The Spanish may have a reputation for theatrics, whining and generally spending too long rolling around on the floor like pansies—and that's infuriating in its own way—but you don't get free kicks for staying down, you get a free kick because the guy in orange clattered you late _again_.

The Netherlands used to play such pretty football; it's a real shame.

On a related note, Dutch legend Johan Cruyff also [criticised the referee](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jul/12/world-cup-final-johan-cruyff-holland)… for not sending off more Dutch players.
