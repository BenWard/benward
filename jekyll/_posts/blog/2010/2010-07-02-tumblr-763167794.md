Behind the goal picture shows just how bad that handball was. Gutted for Ghana.

On related note, The Guardian yesterday published a [really great article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2010/jun/30/world-cup-2010-ghana-history) by Jonathan Wilson, all about Ghana's near fifty year wait for achievement on a world stage. Well worth a read before they go home.
