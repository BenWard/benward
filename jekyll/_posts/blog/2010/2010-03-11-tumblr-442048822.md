[Socialite](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/socialite/) is a rather magnificent Twitter (and Facebook, RSS, Flickr) client for Mac OSX. I really need to write up ‘how I use it’ properly at some point, because it's full of really smart, but quite buried little features that make me happy.

One of the more obviously useful features, though, is Smart Folders, which are just like smart folders everywhere else in Mac OSX, and can be used to filter content. The picture above shows how I'll be coping with my absence from South By South West this year.
