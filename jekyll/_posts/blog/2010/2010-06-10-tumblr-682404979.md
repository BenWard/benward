Safari 5 has implemented geolocation (as already found in Mobile Safari, and Snow Leopard in general.)

Steve Jobs mentioned in [his D8 interview](http://kara.allthingsd.com/20100607/full-d8-video-apple-ceo-steve-jobs/) that they take location privacy very seriously, and the ‘don't ask for 24 hours’ checkbox is nice evidence of that; there's no ‘Always Allow’ option.

Of course, I'd still like to see disclosure granularity at the source—ala [Fire Eagle](http://fireeagle.yahoo.com)—but this is an improvement on the ‘OK/Cancel’ interface that the iPhone throws up.
