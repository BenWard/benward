I rather luckily got a place at the @media conference in cloudy London yesterday, and had a fantastic time learning more web design from some supremely talented and entertaining speakers.

I will do a full write up, but I need to finish a university assignment first. This post serves as a place to stick comments if I met you and you think you knew me from somewhere (<a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy Keith</a>, <em>where</em> do you know my name from? It's slightly terrifying).

Anyway, to keep a couple of "yes, of course I'll blog that" promises before I have time to do something more thorough: Jeremy and <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk">Andy Clarke</a>'s presentations were the two which got through to me the most. The former for 'I kinda knew I could do that but never saw how' JavaScript enlightenment, and the latter for his presentation that I've renamed: 'A slap in face for everyone who needs to get a grip on the balance between standards-adherence and great design'. Andy's original title was better, mind.

Also, a huge thank you to Jon Hicks for living up to his friendly reputation and introducing me to all these great people.
