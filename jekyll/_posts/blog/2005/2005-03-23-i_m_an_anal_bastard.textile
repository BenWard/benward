The <a href="http://www.conservatives.com" title="The Conservative Party">Conservative</a> party in the UK have launched a <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=party.toolbar.page" title="Conservatives.com Toolbar">toolbar for Internet Explorer</a>. Although they have no chance of getting my vote, I figured I'd test out their ability to respond to anal questions anyway...
<blockquote>While I'm sure that no Conservative politician has any input into the creation of the "Conservatives.com toolbar", I'm curious to know if there will be versions produced for other web browser software, such as Mozilla's wonderful Firefox browser. 

Surely it is only right that a political party should be encouraging the freedom of choice that Mozilla offer from Microsoft's aged and under-featured product?</blockquote>

Sometimes, the simple pleasures in life are not to be sniffed at.
