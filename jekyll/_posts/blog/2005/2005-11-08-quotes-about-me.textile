<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hicksdesign/57979873/#comment16731791" title="Cheese Camp on Flickr - Comments">This</a> made me smile earlier on in the most childish of ways.

Apart from that fact that I manged to intuitively guess the operation of the hReview microformat (one which I'm not familar, hCal and hCard are more my thing at the moment), I can now claim the following was said of me by a <a href="http://tantek.com/log/" title="Tantek Çelik">highly respected member of internet society</a>:

<blockquote cite="http://flickr.com/photos/hicksdesign/57979873/#comment16731791"><p>Ben - you're right</p></blockquote>

Consider the magnatude of it: My CV will be a doddle; references from the McDonald's summer job a thing of a tragic past now forgotten.

Alternatively, I can displace McDonald's with <a href="http://joshuaink.com">Oxton</a>'s fine endorsement:

<blockquote cite="http://joshuaink.com/blog/499/flowery-fing-flowery"><p>[the] prize goes to Ben Ward for being one of life's true dingleberries.</p></blockquote>

Apparently some other people have been saying that I'm a ‘nice guy’ behind my back, but who needs word-of-mouth endorsements when you can abuse context like this?

Ever had anything good said about you?

      <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve had various good things said about me, throughout my life ranging from &lsquo;what a lovely baby&rsquo; to &lsquo;you seem like a pretty cool guy&rsquo; (by a big-name Brit Packer, no less).</p>
<p>More worrying, however, is the fact that you, Ben, appear to be the <a href="http://nascentguruism.com/archives/" rel="nofollow">most popular tag on my blog posts</a>.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>‘Brit Packer’, reminds me a little too much of Newround&#8217;s junior reporters club matey. I&#8217;d stick to ‘Proud Members’.</p>
<p>And yes, I know what a dingleberry is. I felt it was a good one to include in case anyone accidently took me seriously.</p></div>
