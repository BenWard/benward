This statement is getting pinned to my desk during software design sessions.

<blockquote cite="http://blog.ben-ward.co.uk"><em>Why</em> is there a Media Player built into Open Office? <strong>Why</strong> is it in the tools menu of the word processor?</blockquote>

Answers on a postcard. There may well be a postcard generator built into the Mozilla Suite.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s not even been bundled with the intend of being any good or trying to beat some other product in market share. I just can&#8217;t comprehend the <em>purpose</em> of it.</p>
<p>Sure, maybe some kind of multimedia hooks would be appropriate in an Office Suite, but <strong>that&#8217;s why we have file associations</strong> and a means of choosing a preferred media player application.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s wasted effort, feature bloat and it&#8217;s a bloody item on the Tools menu that <em>three people in the universe</em> will ever use.</p>
<p>The first part of the Firefox aftermath has been that Open Source projects now have stonking great big &#8220;Download&#8221; links on their homepages. Part two needs to be applying the same &#8220;Why the fuck is that feature even part of our application?&#8221; attitude and (hopefully) encouraging some real UI designers into projects.</p>
<p>It must be quite humilating to produce applications that get trounced for usability by Microsoft&#8217;s hopscotch approach to user interface&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same kind of sympathy I&#8217;m preparing for the <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> development team; the feeling of producing a brand new application that&#8217;s not in any way as good as any of your significant rivals is really horrid.</p></div>
