Having been poking around inside my website's control panel this evening I finally found the access stats package (awstats, it appears). After peering at browser access percentages (IE 50%, Firefox 30%) I spotted an option to tell me the most popular search terms that led to my blog. The result was interesting, a <a href="http://blog.ben-ward.co.uk/archive/2004/11/14/stuffplug_ng_msn_plugin_plugin#comments" title="StuffPlug NG - MSN Plugin-Plugin">past entry on the subject of Stuffplug-NG </a> for MSN Messenger dominates 30% of all incoming searches. Strange. I actually rank 6th on <a href="http://www.google.com" title="Google">Google</a> on the subject. I'll concede that my current understanding of search engines isn't gigantic, but that seems odd.

Two of my better posts crop up: Searches for "<a href="http://blog.ben-ward.co.uk/archive/2004/10/06/ipod_usb_error" title="iPod. It arrived...">iPod disk write error</a>" and "<a href="http://blog.ben-ward.co.uk/archive/2004/10/26/unoffical_radiohead_album_covers" title="Radiohead Bootleg Album covers">radiohead album art</a>" get a handful of percentage points each. All of which get more than searching "Ben Ward".

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Not too surprisingly, my top search phrase is &#8220;fatty&#8221;, albeit only with 15% of the searches. Slightly more worrying are &#8220;warren leblanc&#8221; (the guy who murdered his friend and whose parents blamed Manhunt) and &#8220;suicidegirls pass&#8221; (related, apparently, to an ancient comment on a post about BugMeNot).</p>
<p>Oh, and I have 35% Firefoxers &#8211; beat you ;-)</p></div>
