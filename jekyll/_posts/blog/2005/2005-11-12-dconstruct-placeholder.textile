<img class="splash" src="/media/splashes/dconstruct.splash.png" alt="Regarding d.Construct:" /> A full write-up is coming next week, but here's a handy placeholder for anyone I met (or not) that would like to leave a message.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Handy indeed!<br />
Great to meet you and Steve last week.  In fact, I just clocked this evening that Steve is the Steve from nascentguruism.com!  God, I&#8217;m slow.  (Isn&#8217;t his site one of those irritating ones where you can&#8217;t help thinking &#8220;wish I&#8217;d thought of that&#8221;? That&#8217;s some sort of complement, I suppose.)</p>
<p>Anyway I could go on with heaps of how awesome d.Construct was but I think I&#8217;ll post about it on my site soon&#8230;</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>It is indeed the same Steve. And yes, whilst I can soothe my jealousy towards his site with thoughts of �I helped�, I didn&#8217;t really help enough to take any credit away from him. Must try harder next time�</p></div>
