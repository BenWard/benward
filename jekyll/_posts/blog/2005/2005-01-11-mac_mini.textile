As a small aside from writing my forthcoming presentation on an accessible internet.

Today, Apple announced the <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/macmini/" title="Apple Mac Mini">Mac Mini</a>. It's an Apple Mac. But very, very small. It's silver colour. You use your existing screen/keyboard and it costs <span title="340">little more than</span> an <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/ipod/" title="Apple iPod">iPod</a>. And it's a Mac. A full featured, all singing Mac.

Please, don't even ask if I want one, else I may accidently click the "Buy Buy Buy" button. I <em>really</em> can't afford it. This month.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Aye. These little machines are going to get picked up for all kinds of little duties like that I recon, as well as being able to introduce home-user types to a cheap PC replacement when they have one Blue Screen of Death too many.</p>
