<a href="http://www.ellythompson.co.uk/blog/2005/05/17/musical-baton/" title="Elly Thompson: Musical Baton" rel="friend">Elly</a> has sent the infamous musical baton my way (which, by pleasant coincidence puts me only 5 degrees of separation from <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/general/destinations.html" title="The Brit Pack">the Brit Pack</a>).

It's nice to see a chain-letter concept mature. Via email this would've been nothing but frustration and instant deletion but through Blogging it becomes well presented and proves fascinating to see such a huge number of people partake in a giant conversation on a common interest. I like.

The geek in me wonders if anyone has written a spider to analyse all these posts (and then ponders if having a <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/MicroFormat" title="Technorati: Microformats">microformat</a> to mark-up musical meta data would make such an exercise easier).

Anyway, I digress.

<dl>
<dt>The total volume of music files stored on my computer:</dt>
<dd><p>I have 34GB of MP3 audio, which at my preferred high bit-rate works out at 4363 individual pieces of music. iTunes says it will take 12.3 days to listen to it all.</p></dd>
<dt>The last CD I bought was:</dt>
<dd>All Maps Welcome by <a href="http://www.tommcrae.com">Tom McRae</a></dd>
<dd><p>I'm a huge fan of Tom. As much as singer-songwriters are ten-a-penny in the UK right now, Tom is by far one of the best and by extension, least commercially successful (figure that out).</p>
<p>All of his albums are sublime, intricate, emotive and regularly rather morbid.</p></dd>
<dt>The song I'm playing right now is:</dt>
<dd>Decent Days and Nights by The Futureheads</dd>
<dd><p>It's adrenaline in a song...</p></dd>
<dt>Five songs I listen to a lot, or that mean a lot to me:</dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>"Lucky" - <a href="http://www.radiohead.com">Radiohead</a></dt>
<dd><p>Picking 5 songs for this list is hard enough when just picking out my favourite 5 Radiohead songs would leave me stumped for hours. "Lucky" is a masterpiece.</p></dd>
<dt>"Lonely Soul" - <a href="http://www.unkle.com/">Unkle</a></dt>
<dd><p>A product of collaboration between <a href="http://www.djshadow.com/">DJ Shadow</a>'s Unkle project and The Verve's <a href="http://www.richardashcroft.com/">Richard Ashcroft</a>. Possibly the best piece of music the latter has ever produced.</p></dd>
<dt>"Northern Lites" - <a href="http://www.superfurry.com">Super Furry Animals</a></dt>
<dd><p>SFA are one of my favourites bands in the universe. "Northern Lites", with its floaty rhythm and always fantastic steel drums is the song which defines summertime to me.</p></dd>
<dt>"It's The End of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)" - <a href="http://www.remhq.com/">R.E.M.</a></dt>
<dd><p>For all the fabulous music R.E.M. have produced since before-I-was-born, this is the song I <em>always</em> come back to and bounce around my bedroom like an utter loon.</p></dd>
<dt>"Good to Me" by <a href="http://www.brendanbenson.com/">Brendan Benson</a></dt>
<dd><p>Fantastically bouncy power-pop tune. The observant will see this on <a href="http://jo.ben-ward.co.uk" title="Jo Anslow" rel="friend met muse sweetheart">Jo</a>'s list too.</p></dd></dl>
</dd>
<dt><del>Five</del> Three people to whom Iï¿½m passing the baton:</dt>
<dd>Steve (Blog is, err, pending)</dd>
<dd>Steve</dd>
<dd>Alex</dd>
