I've become a big fan of iCal on the Mac. iCal has got a the fine balance of �features vs. simplicity� about right, so suddenly my life is colour coded. 

I've got 9 calendars in it (hence the colour coding). Personal stuff, Birthdays (linked to the Address Book), Coursework tasks and deadlines, Lecture schedules, University events, Work, Gigs, integration with <a href="http://backpackit.com">Backpack</a> and finally �Television�.

I'm terrible at remembering to watch TV. I get deeply into reading miscellany on the internet that the time just passes by. So I've started adding the schedules into iCal. OK, that's �schedule� singular, since the only programme I care enough to watch at the moment is Danny Wallace's fantastic �<a href="http://citizensrequired.com">How to start your own country</a>�.

Now (to the point), the thought occurs that this system would be <em>far better</em> if the BBC, Radio Times or <em>someone</em> has a service whereby I could browse the TV listings for all the channels I have access too, tick a check-box next to the programmes I want to watch and then have it generate an iCalendar to subscribe to in iCal. Voil�, TV listings synchronised with iCal. This will then implicitly synchronise with my phone and someday a neural implant (probably called the �iMind� or following the current Apple love of super-heroes: �Pinky�).

      <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems you&#8217;re on the same wavelength as the <span class="caps">BBC</span>, Ben! They recently announced an initiative to get people to come up with innovative ways of accessing TV listings. You ought to put your idea forward. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4707187.stm" rel="nofollow"><span class="caps">BBC</span> News</a> has the details.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Indeed, the BBC&#8217;s backstage project does provide a fantastic opportunity to provide things like this. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve got the knowledge to do this myself, but will certainly propose it to their ideas pile.</p>
<p>Actually, this is the sort of thing that embedded hCalendar Microformat mark-up into the listings pages could be beneficial towards, too.</p>
<p>I do live the possibilities of technology.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Came across this when googling &#8220;iCal TV&#8221;. Actually doing something like this for Swedish TV listings (from <span class="caps">XMLTV</span> sources):  http://henrik.nyh.se/blog/2006/07/27/icaltv-ical-reminders-for-favorite-tv-shows-through-xmltv/</p>
<p>That solution could probably be adapted for other listings and other platforms (though I won&#8217;t do it :p).</p></div>
