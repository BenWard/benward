Feeling a bit arty this evening I did a T-Shirt design based on the excellent "LiveMarks" icon from <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a>. I'm quite a fan of XML feeds and the potential for the technology's use in different forms of data syndication (Microsoft SharePoint, I'm calling you out - again).
<img src="/media/WellFed.png" alt="T-Shirt design based on Firefox's LiveMarks icon" /> 
As a T-Shirt I'll admit it is, well, rather nerdy. It would mean wandering around wearing the icon from a computer program on my chest. But it is a <em>very</em> cool icon. To be honest, I think it fits into a similar vein to the too-cool-for-words set of designs that <a href="http://www.panic.com/goods/" title="Panic Software Shop">Panic now sell</a>.

Needless to say, I shan't be wandering around in it tomorrow because my printer has decided to spit red ink over everything that comes near it. Another day.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi Shane,</p>
<p>The ‘again’ was a bit of a in-joke for the benefit of <a href="http://nascentguruism.com" rel="nofollow">Steve Marshall</a>. The blog readership was much lower when this was written, I&#8217;d never considered it being much of a talking point!</p>
<p>The story is essentially that 14 months ago Steve and I worked for a company that&#8217;d just attempted a rather substantial Sharepoint deployment. It was imposed on us for the purposes of bug tracking and quite low-level task management. We found the experience absolutely torrid: The lack of full Firefox support, the grotesque <span class="caps">HTML</span> that prevented user-side customisation, clunky UI (form submit buttons at the <em>top</em> of pages, when the forms required significant scrolling) and the one referenced here, the lack of feeds in that version of Sharepoint.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t doubt they&#8217;ll have improved in the Office 12 Edition, if only because they couldn&#8217;t possibly have made it worse.</p></div>
