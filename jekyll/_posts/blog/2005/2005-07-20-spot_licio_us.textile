The more I play with my Mac, the more I like. I vow that I shall write something not about the Mac soon. But for now, read this. It's stupidly cool. And I'll try and keep it shorter, too.

As you'll note from the current recent entry in my sidebar, all my 'link blog' bookmarks are now stored in <a href="http://del.icio.us/Shovel">Del.icio.us</a> (online bookmarks, with tags ala Flickr).

Mac OSX has a cool integrated desktop search feature called <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/">Spotlight</a> and you can install a selection of plug-ins to enhance it. The following screenshot should reveal everything that's cool about this.

<a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/spotlight/delimport.html" title="delimport">Such a plug-in exists</a> to allow searching Del.icio.us bookmarks from Spotlight. It means that you simply <em>don't need</em> to use the Bookmarks feature in your browser. Just hit <kbd title="Command">?</kbd>+Space and type a tag name, or the name of the site. Hit <kbd>Return</kbd> and the site loads in the default browser.

<img class="screenshot" src="/media/splashes/spot.licio.us.splash.jpg"  alt="Bookmarks from Del.icio.us are listed alongside any other local content on your computer that matches your search. In this case, I search for �webdev� and receive everything with the corresponding tag in Del.icio.us." />

It's gorgeously slick and means I wont ever need to worry about syncing my bookmarks from PC to Mac and browser-to-browser.
