Via BBC News: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4326286.stm">Fire hits Wallance and Gromit sets</a>

I love Wallace and Gromit. �A Grand Day Out�, �The Wrong Trousers� and �A Close Shave� all brought me a huge amount of pleasure as a child. It's really quite upsetting, then, to learn of today's fire that's destroyed pretty much all of Aardman and Nick Park's work (apart from the new film, thankfully). Artifacts destroyed also include �Creature Comforts� and �Chicken Run� sets.

<blockquote cite="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4326286.stm">Everything has gone, from as far back as Morph and all the way through to Chicken Run, including Wallace and Gromit, Creature Comforts, it's all there. Everyone is devastated.</blockquote>

Nick Park is quoted somewhat calmer than I'd be in his shoes (I'd be emotionally crushed), he comments that in comparison to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/south_asia/2005/south_asia_quake/default.stm" title="2005 South Asia Earthquake (BBC News)">what's going on in the rest of the world right now,</a> it's not that big a deal.

Still really sad though.
