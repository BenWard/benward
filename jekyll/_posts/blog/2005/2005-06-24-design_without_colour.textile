You may be aware that I've been quietly and not-so-quietly planning a major redesign of these pages for a while now. It involves switching from <a href="http://b2evolution.com">b2Evo</a> to <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, tweaking it, customising it and finally revealing a new look to call my own.

There journey so far has not been entirely productive. In journey terms - for those into wreckless analogies - we're about half way down the driveeway. There have been a number of hitches and associated excuses before now, but with some pride this particular hitch is <em>actually related to doing the design</em>. This is progress, see? Crappy progress yes, but at least I'm gaining.

My first designs are always on paper. I have an A4 pad of squared paper (the kind with 80 sheets and the slightly smaller squares) which I sketch designs onto whilst sitting on train journeys. The designs I've got are good, they look unashamedly like a blog. The problem is that they're all grey outlines. Grey pencil, to be precise.

Now I'm sitting with a logo design that I'm pleased with, a layout I like, some thoughts about typography and many thoughts about HTML structure. But no colour. I've become completely accustomed to my new design being greyscale and as much as I try to think through colour ideas it all ends up feeling unbalanced and overpowering.

I have some plans to resolve the problem, but I've no idea if they'll work. Plan number 1 is to 'borrow' as many colour swatches from Homebase as I can and then introduce them to a pair of scissors. Plan number 2 is to learn to make digital colour swatches by following the instructions of <a href="http://joshuaink.com/blog/144/" title="Making a colour swatch in Fireworks">Oxton</a> and <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/creating_colour_palettes.html" title="Creating colour palettes">Clarke</a> (<a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/web_imitates_art.html" title="Web imitates art">twice</a>). I'm just terrified that it might not help...

So, please lend an idea or three; how do <em>you</em> do colour?

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Usually once i&#8217;ve got the site layout looking how i want it on paper, i will mock it up in illustrator and colour it in there, i find it easy to swap colours then, and its also good for placing your type.I also find it helps if i print out these designs so i can doodle on them later if i get new ideas</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Seriously though, besides carrying coloured pencils (and a camera, you never know when you&#8217;re going to find something that&#8217;s a great colour) I find the best way to design <em>for</em> colour is to design <em>with</em> colour &#8211; adjusting later is always easier than adding later.</p>
<p>And besides, who said greyscale isn&#8217;t a perfectly valid colour palette.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>That&#8217;s one of the problems. The greyscale sketches look really nice. I&#8217;d actually really like to try and build a page out of pencil sketches. It would be image heavy as lead (or at least, as image heacy as a high resolution picture of lead) but could look really rather nice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m off to buy a pocket sized box of pencils. And a new belt to which I can attach my camera. Thanks for those ideas.</p></div>
