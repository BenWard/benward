I've been wanting a dual screen set up for simply ages now. We've had two screens at work pretty much since we started and I'm hooked to point of clinical dependency.

Thanks to the staff purchase scheme I've got something close a 2-for-1 type price on Fujitsu Siemens highest-end 19" model. I'm really rather happy about it.

Colour is good, they're both impressively bright and the bezel is slim all around (which makes working across both screens that bit nicer). Oh, and the "on" lights are a lovely soft shade of bluey-purple.

Of course, now I need a faster computer to run more applications at the same time to fill the extra space. Well, there's a lot of new stuff to practice since @media...
