I'm still trying to suss out a reliable, CMS independent way of tracking the comments I've made. It's a step back in terms of automation, but using a <a href="http://delicious.com">Delicious</a> tag seems functional at least - and it lends itself a quick and dirty Bookmarklet too.

I've not integrated any feeds into the site yet, and won't have time to for a little bit, but if you want to see what's got me talking, you can find it <a href="http://del.icio.us/BenWard/@commented-on">tagged with @commented-on</a>.

Edit: The bookmarklet I speak of is a simple modification of the standard Delicious "Add to Delcious" affair, and looks like this:

<pre><code>javascript:location.href='http://del.icio.us/USERNAME?v=3&url='
  + encodeURIComponent(location.href)
  + '&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)
  + '&tags=@commented-on'
</code></pre>
