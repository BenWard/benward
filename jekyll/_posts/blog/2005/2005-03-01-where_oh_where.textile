February wasn't a good month for this blog. Not only did I manage a paltry <em>one</em> post but I also broke my Blogroll script. Ultimately, not going well.

Since then I've been trying (in vain) to fix said Blogroll, plus working late and dedicating some time to a new web project which hopefully will see light of day soon.

Blog still lives, just gotta try and and fix it.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Blogroll is fixed! It now functions through a Perl script run hourly on the webserver. This seems to more reliably download the <span class="caps">RSS</span> than my old integrated-<span class="caps">PHP</span> script. Has a bonus result not having any effect on the production speed of actual pages (since the data is processed in the background) and I can change the regularity of updates from the ease of my Cron control panel. Much, much nicer than having it hacked into the top of the <span class="caps">PHP</span> rendering script.</p>
<p>In fact, with the process now separated and external, it leads to way for making it do rather more advanced tricks (such as looking up &#8216;most recent entry&#8217; titles for each blog). Because it&#8217;s all in the background I can now afford to write a process that might take rather longer to run. Play time&#8230;</p></div>
