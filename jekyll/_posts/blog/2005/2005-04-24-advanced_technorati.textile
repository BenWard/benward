I actually looked at <a href="http://www.technorati.com/profile/shovel" title="Technorati: Ben Ward">my Technorati profile</a> again this evening and notice that next to my claimed weblog, it says:
<blockquote>Claimed with Quick Claim. To enable advanced features, cancel and reclaim by editing your blog template.</blockquote>
So, what advanced features are these? This must be a stonking example for making words into hyperlinks - the words being "advanced features" and the hyperlink pointing to a page explaining them, please.

Am I missing out on something useful here? I can't figure it out.
