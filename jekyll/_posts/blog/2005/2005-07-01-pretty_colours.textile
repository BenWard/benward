<img src="/media/splashes/wondercolour.splash.gif" alt="" class="splash" />I've been making a bit of an effort in recent entries to start adding a related image to my posts. Obviously my redesign is a way off, but I've found that they do serve to brighten the place up a bit. It's also helping to alleviate some of my 'colour block' I <a href="http://blog.ben-ward.co.uk/archive/2005/06/24/design_without_colour" title="The problem of designing without colour">spoke of recently</a>.

The choices of images aren't hugely inspired - although Neil Buchanan appears as a small nod to my childhood and a reminder that Art Attack was the single good television program on cITV.
<p class="aside">Aside: Markup wankers will note that the images are inserted a tad strange: They're referenced by a full URI rather than just the relative path, and the <code>&lt;img /></code> includes the long deprecated 'align' attribute. Basically, it's a combination of working around a strange bug in b2Evolution's post validation and being too lazy to alter my soon-to-be-replaced stylesheet. I'll convert the latter it to a proper, semantic class when I migrate to Wordpress, I promise.</p>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>this post officially wins the &#8216;best post this year containing a picture of Neil Buchanan with an oversized paintbrush&#8217; award. Congratulations!</p>
<p>i also heard that those red sweaters he wears cost around �500 each because theyre made with some special material, because normal �10 matalan sweaters cause horrendous colour bleed on screen. or something.</p></div>
