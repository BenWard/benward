This is ordinarilly buried under the "Wider Web" sidebar, but since it's election day I think it deserves greater prominence.

<a href="http://www.honourablefiend.com/" title="The Honourable Fiend">The Honourable Fiend</a> has a nice takeoff of the "Choose Life" format: <a href="http://www.honourablefiend.com/archives/2005/05/choose_labour.html" title="Choose Labour - The Honourable Fiend">Choose Labour</a>.

It serves two purposes, firstly as an impressively condensed reminder of Labour's eight years which may or may not be serve as an aid when you vote. Also, if through some epoch defining accident the Tories win (they wont), it will make you feel less bad about it on Friday.

If it hasn't been repeated enough times on the Internet already, do remember that "a vote for the Lib Dems will let the Tories in" is a <strong>lie</strong> and that contrary to Labour party campaigning, you're free to vote for whichever of our political parties you like.

Go vote. Now is good.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Sadly, due to my own failure to apply for a postal vote, I won&#8217;t be able to have my say this time around. Well, I could if i really wanted to, but it would involve a 3 hour round-trip, and given the cost of petrol (grumble grumble) I dont think it&#8217;s worth it!</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah, in theory. It&#8217;d be illegal though&#8230; I suspect they would check on their computer, and see that I&#8217;d been granted a postal vote. Kayleigh went to vote. She feels all empowered and grown up!</p></div>
