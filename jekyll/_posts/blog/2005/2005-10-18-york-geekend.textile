Just a short post this one. I had the great pleasure of meeting up with some other like-minded geeks in York on Saturday.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/search/tags:geekend%2Cyork/tagmode:all/" title="Photos tagged �geekend� and �york� - Flickr">Pictures are now up on Flickr</a>, thus the task of recalling people's names has begun.

I promised at the time that I'd forget names within minutes, as I tend to do, and that promise was predominantly kept. Thankfully other photographers are not so awful as me; with the aid of their Flickr captions I should have it sussed out for the next time.

Also, can anyone suggest a better way of linking to Flickr photos than just a tag search for �york� and �geekend�? It works at the moment, but should we (or anyone else) meet there again, the search results aren't going to be accurate. I can't find a way to limit searches by date�

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi Ben. Was good to meet up with everyone. And I&#8217;m pretty sure no one was sure on names but it didn&#8217;t seem to halt the fun.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll add any half decent pictures to the flickr when I get round to it.</p>
<p>Just have to wait for the next one!</p>
