There's a new group on <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.FM</a>, it's called <a href="http://www.last.fm/group/The%2BLegion%2Bof%2BBen">The Legion of Ben</a> and it's for people whose name is also Ben.

It was convieved in a moment of lunatic collaboration with <a href="http://www.benedictoneill.com/">Ben O'Neill</a>, but I still maintain that it's got a great name.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>We seem to have attracted one additional Ben in only a few days, so my plan is to leave it for a bit and see whether any more wander in.</p>
<p>One of the more frustrating things about Last.FM is the number of duplicate groups. For some reason there are two generic &#8216;Manchester Universities&#8217; groups, as well as dedicated ones for the individual unis themselves. Gah, people should learn to search!</p></div>

<q>Gah</q>, people should learn to search &#8211; surely that&#8217;s like saying &#8220;people should learn to read the instructions on forms&#8221;? It&#8217;s one of those things that would make everything so much easier, but people think they know what they&#8217;re doing so they think they don&#8217;t need to bother!<br />
Maybe Last.FM should implement a group merging in the same way as they implemented artist merging for misspelt artists :)</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, that&#8217;d be a no on the <span class="caps">HTML</span> working :D The bold was supposed to be asterisks and the &#8220;gah&#8221; quote was meant to be quoted in &#8216;q&#8217; tags. It&#8217;d be nice if it told us it&#8217;d strip <span class="caps">HTML</span> :P :D</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not 100% sure what the state of <span class="caps">HTML</span> input is on the current set up. <span class="caps">HTML</span> isn&#8217;t stripped, but I believe Wordpress may operate with a subset of <span class="caps">HTML</span> tags, and strip <code>&amp;lt;q&amp;gt;</code></p>
<p>The reason for the bolding of your * * text is because I have the excelllent Textile shorthand enabled, but again I&#8217;m not sure of any quirks in the way it interacts with <span class="caps">HTML</span> input. I&#8217;ll be testing it more thoroughly at some point, probably when I go through my old entries to tag them.</p>
<p>Oddly, if I edit your comment I can happily add <code>&amp;lt;q&gt;</code> elements. Strange.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Maybe it just doesn&#8217;t trust me with <span class="caps">HTML</span> :D It does seem to be showing different <span class="caps">HTML</span> in the source now that you&#8217;ve edited it. My Linux Firefox seems to be showing a lot of random q tags all over though!</p>
<p>Maybe I should make a &#8220;Legion of IBBoard&#8221; group &#8211; although I should be the only one in there :D</p></div>
