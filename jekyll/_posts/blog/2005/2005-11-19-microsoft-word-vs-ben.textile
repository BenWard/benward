<img class="splash" src="/media/splashes/WordBullets.splash.png" alt="" /> Here I am writing up my final report and Word is doing everything in its power to frustrate me. One of the most irritating of its �features� is related to hung quotes (the use of which <a href="http://nascentgugruism.com">Stevie</a>'s typography quest got me into and and I now respond to indented quotes in my documents with faux choking).

Basically, Word was happy with my unordered list style, but refused to automatically hang numbered lists. Each time I select the style I'd have to drag the number back out into the margin. Minor annoyance. Except that when I choose �restart numbering� for subsequent lists, Word will immediately revert to the default indentation. So I scroll up again and drag each list back in to place.

Then, just now, I restarted numbering on a numbered list again and all my <strong>unordered</strong>, bulleted lists jumped. The bullet sits in the margin, but the text is a centimetre indented.

I swear, it's going to be easier to write the final report in HTML.

Oh, just in case anyone is ready to get pedantic on any terminology; I know my typography lexicon sucks.

Update: And, as if by magic <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/boom" title="Printing a Book with CSS - Boom!">here the creators of CSS write about styling for print</a>. Eerie, eh?

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Perhaps� I seem to recall that Fatty wrote his final report in LaTex (or however the capitalisation is). I have no experience with it at all. Perhaps in the time between finishing this report and starting the final report I&#8217;ll convert it to something less volatile than Word.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m genuinely starting to think that HTML+CSS is the way to go with this. with Firefox 1.5 supporting <span class="caps">CSS</span> counters for generated content, it covers common presentation like automatic heading numbering, the block level structure for lists is vastly superior to Word&#8217;s styling system and a script to automatically generate a table of contents and table of figures based on heading levels and/or class names would be a doddle.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll do a proper assessment of it when my coursework burden is cleared for Christmas. I suspect it will boil down to the level of support I can find for print specific <span class="caps">CSS</span> (page breaks and stuff).</p></div>

<p>I see you are working hard at your project.  Thankfully I can slide along here in work doing nothing without worrying about my project anymore.</p>
