Seeing as I'm leaving for this in all of 25 minutes, I don't expect much to come of it, but if you're in Manchester and fancy some rock, it's <a href="http://www.nowayback.co.uk">No Way Back #3</a> at the <a href="http://www.nightnday.org/">Night & Day</a> on Oldham Street.

<a href="http://fictitioustheband.com">Fictitious</a> and <a href="http://ptatheband.com">PTA</a> are both playing, which practically makes it something a Plews-fest (minus the usual smelly residue). Plews was my flatmate a year ago, for those confused.

Anyway, PTA are the bollocks (and have <a href="http://ptatheband.com/downloads.html">some songs for download</a> if you're still in doubt). Fictitious I've not heard since they got their new singer but everything suggests that they should also tweak the definition of awesomeness.

So, if you're sitting in Manchester not knowing what you'll be doing in an hours time, tickets are �5 on the door. You can get fliers, but I lost the URL and I'd probably get in trouble for mirroring them, and they only save you ‘1 anyway’ I'll be there, dressed pretty much <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/benward/63691682/">the same as I am in this picture</a>.
