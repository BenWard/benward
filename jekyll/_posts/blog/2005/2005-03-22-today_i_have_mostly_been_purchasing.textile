<img src="/media/BlocParty-SilentAlarm.jpg" title="Cover Art for Bloc Party's &quot;Silent Alarm&quot;" alt="" class="splash" />... CDs. In fact, I seem to have developed a dependence on buying new CDs. My iPod has a playlist, y'see, which contains all the music that I've bought in the last two weeks. When that list empties I get an overpowering urge to buy more to fill it up again (rather than, say, change the SmartPlaylist to contain three weeks music rather than two...).

Technophile dependency aside, I've bought <a href="http://www.beck.com/">Beck</a>'s new "Guero", <a href="http://www.thebravery.com/" title="The Bravery">The Bravery</a>'s self-titled debut and the fantastically good Silent Alarm by <a href="http://www.blocparty.com/" title="Bloc Party">Bloc Party</a>. The latter is heavily recommended for being "Just. So. Good".
