I'm back home in Cambridge for the long Easter weekend. Thanks to our countries Christian heritage, we get given Good Friday and Easter Monday off work. This is a good thing, since <a href="http://jo.ben-ward.co.uk" title="Jo Anslow's Weblog">Jo</a> keeps telling me I'm stressed, and she tends to be right about such things. In response, I will doing absolutely nothing tomorrow. Apart from possibly introducing my mother to Picasa, just because it's so cool.

I'm still playing the Bloc Party album to death too.
