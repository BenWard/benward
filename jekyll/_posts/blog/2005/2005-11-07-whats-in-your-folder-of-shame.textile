<a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000811.html" "Jeffrey Veen">Jeffrey Veen asks ‘What's in your folder of shame?’</a>, referring to the ‘drafts’ folder. Unfinished blogs, second thoughts? We've all got them. Since we're sharing, here's my current list of working titles:

* CSS Inline Lists
* JavaScript Reflection
* Working with Web Standards vs. Content Management
* The influence of Mac
* Inconsistant design annoys me
* Scaling graphics

There was another one that might be worth mention for ‘mild bemusement’ value. It contained no text at all, not even a note to remind me what to write, and was entitled ‘Poor Jon Hicks’. It was very old, but I have not the faintest incling of an idea what it was supposed to say. It's been deleted now, so if <a href="http://hicksdesign.co.uk">Jon</a> was owed any sympathy for something about 6 months ago, I'm afraid he'll just have to cope without.

The rest of those in the list might get finished. Perhaps.
