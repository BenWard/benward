<img class="splash" src="/media/splashes/ibook.splash.jpg" alt="" />As a short follow-up to <a href="http://blog.ben-ward.co.uk/archive/2005/04/12/on_whether_to_take_a_bite" title="On whether or not to take a bite�">my obligatory 'should I get a Mac' post</a>, here's an update.

I got bored waiting for what will (when it comes) be a tiny, tiny update to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibook/">iBook</a> line. I'd hoped for a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/coreimage/">CoreImage</a> supporting graphics chip, but I've waited two months and further waiting no-longer seems worth it for a small benefit. It's not like I'm waiting for a G5 processor.

A new education offer in the US (which promotes the iBook a bit) adds strength to the theory that we're not going to see updates until after the start of the academic year anyway, and I want it in time for Uni. Lack of CoreImage isn't so important on a 12" portable, really.

I ordered the machine last week and due to some astonishingly low prices on 256 meg RAM from <a href="http://crucial.com/uk">Crucial</a>, I took an extra upgrade for the 80GB hard-disk. It should arrive <span class="datetime" title="2005-07-14">tomorrow</span>.

I've also bought some odds-and-sods from eBay: a padded sleeve case, Kensington lock and second power supply. Generally a good experience from eBay, although one thing that bugs me incessantly though is the utter crap feedback comments. Other than the somewhat too short 80 character limit, the incessant "A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus times infinity no returns" type comments left by other buyers is utterly unhelpful to me. <em>Why do people do this</em>?

Of course, if Apple update the iBooks tomorrow, I do reserve the right to go on a bloody and destructive rampage. Such is the risk with Apple� shitcr�pes that they are.

Footnote: I'd also like to dedicate the new word 'shitcr�pes' to John Oxton, a man who has entertained, educated and been generally top-drawer to me over the past few months. He's packed in <a href="http://joshuaink.com">JoshuaInk</a> for a bit to concentrate on Real-Life. Best wishes and good luck to you John, you'll be rather sorely missed. <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/this-is-not-the-greatest-blog-in-the-world-this-is-just-a-tribute" title="Hicks Design: This is not the greatest blog in the world, this is just a tribute">Jon Hicks has done a nice tribute</a>.
