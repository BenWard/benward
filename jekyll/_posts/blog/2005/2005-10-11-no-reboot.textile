<img class="splash" src="/media/badges/cssreboot.png"/>This is something I've known for a few days but felt I should announce it for posterity. Whilst my migration from b2Evolution to Wordpress has been a fabulous success, I shan't be completing my design in time for the CSS:Reboot on November 1st.

Reason? Not enough hours in my day. I have an awful lot squabbling for my attention at the moment, the most important of which is supposed to be my university course. If you're lucky, and I get my priorities sorted out, there might be a super-cool web-service friendly desktop search tool out for beta-testing next spring (for anyone that is still using Windows by that point).

I still want to redesign, but I think it'll come in spits rather than waking up one glorious morning to a whole new look. A shame, and I definitely want to do it one day, but that day is not November 1st. Best of luck to everyone else getting finished off.

<p>I also wanted to have something ready for the 1st of November; I think I might make it but my designs are always so minimalist that they typically don&#8217;t take much effort anyway. ;)</p></div>
