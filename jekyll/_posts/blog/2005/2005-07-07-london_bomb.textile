Just a small post. Anyone who's keeping track of today's ongoing terrorist events in London may be interested in watching the following links:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2005/london_explosions/default.stm">BBC News 'London Explosions' in depth</a></li>
<li><a href="http://technorati.com/search/london+bomb">Technorati tagged with 'London Bomb'</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www-us.flickr.com/photos/search/tags:bomb%2Clondon/tagmode:all/">Flickr tagged 'London' and 'Bomb'</a></li>
</ul>

There's also Jo�o Pedro Gon�alves' excellent map of the explosion locations, linked into Google maps. You can find that at http://joaop.no.sapo.pt/london_map.html . I can't hyperlink it because b2Evolution claims it's an invalid URI. It lies.

By pure coincidence, the Google ads on Technorati are predominantly offering advice on how to emigrate to Canada.
