My iBook arrived on Thursday, as predicted. It's a glorious feat of engineering, I must say. Every part of it says 'well built' on it (figuratively, I mean). I love OS X like it were my child (I'm not a parent. If I ever have children I expect to revoke that statement immediately). I love the way I can select the word �figuratively� and look it up in the integrated dictionary to make sure I picked the right word, I love the integrated spell check, I love the Adium instant messenger and I'm very impressed with Safari.

I love the way in which I can use proper typographical characters like � and � with easy to remember keyboard shortcuts. I love the way there's a dedicated key for the ��� symbol. I love the way the keyboard is comfortable, that I can configure the trackpad and external mouse separately and the way in which preferences take effect without having to click �OK�.

I love the simple address book with its integration into Adium and spotlight and the special �birthdays� calendar it puts into iCal. I love the Dashboard and the way I now know whether it's going to rain tomorrow.

I love how laughably easy it is to install applications, and the way in which you can drag pretty much anything, anywhere and it will do something useful. I love the attention to detail on everything. I love the slick-but-not-annoying animations liberally spread around the operating system. I love having the �up� and �down� scroll arrows together at the base of scrollbars.

I love having Wireless networking that �just works� and stays working. I love the doddle that is synchronising my phone with iSync. I love the way in which iSync has an icon just my my K700i.

Finally, I love the way in which this entire entry was written from my bed, unplugged with four hours of battery life remaining, over a wireless network, streaming music from my iTunes enabled PC to my iTunes enabled Mac without skipping a beat.

I've never been happier with a new piece of technology than this, it's worth every penny.
