Proving that reading <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk" title="Hicks Design">Jon Hicks</a>' blog too much has had adverse effects on me; Today I consumed about half a dozen wonderful cups of tea, whilst Saturday involved a trip home to consume a traditional quantity of truely classy cheese (well, softer than soft brie and a wonderful soft cheddar that I need to get the actual name of).

Oh, and I've also taken to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/benward/9037520/" title="Mind the Yellow Line">photographing the ordinary</a>, but thinking that they look rather good (this is less of a specific Hicksism, reassuringly).

Cheese, tea and photography are a good way to be going, though a glass of red wine would probably have topped it off.

All in all, a good weekend. I'm calm, I'm collected and I'm in complete denial about how much work I have to do this week.
