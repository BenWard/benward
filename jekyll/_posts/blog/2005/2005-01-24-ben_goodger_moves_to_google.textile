Firefox lead developer <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/ben/" title="Inside Firefox">Ben Goodger</a> has taken a job at Google. His role in the Mozilla Foundation remains the same as before and he's <strong>not</strong> leaving or taking a reduced role or anything like that. In fact reading his post you could be forgiven for thinking that Google were employing him to work on Firefox.

Anyway, congratulations Ben, I do hope that Google have got you working on some interesting stuff.

Of course, I do hope he realises that by disclosing this the crazed cries of "Google Browser!!" will have reappeared before I've even finished posting this comment. If I were you, I'd duck right. about. now...

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Certainly interesting news for gbrowser &#8211; if they really are working on it. I imagined Ben would be the one they went for. Good to see that he&#8217;s not leaving the moz foundation, and it&#8217;ll be interesting to see what they get him on if it turns out gbrowser is a dud.</p></div>
