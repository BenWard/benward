>After moving to Paris in the ’90s, Adam Love worked as a freelance art director, graphic designer, stylist and consultant. […] [H]e was recently cited as “the most intriguing graphic designer of the moment” (Tsugi magazine) for his work with the label Kill the Dj.

… Which produced the designs above. They're eye catching and kinda cool. But, I cannot escape the clear correlation between imagery of hanging and a ‘_Kill_ the DJ’ brand. I just think you've [misremembered the words to ‘Panic’](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/Panic/+lyrics), and I think less of you for it.

(Additionally, anyone with 15 seconds to spare and a Last.FM account should please go to the [Hang the DJ](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/_/Hang+The+DJ) page, scroll down, click ‘Suggest a Correction’ on the right-hand-side, and do your bit to spare some 7,000 listeners the embarrassment of their mis-tagged music.)
