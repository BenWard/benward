> When it was released we found a few show stopping bugs that neither us nor Apple found which kept new users from playing the game. Whoops. We pushed 1.1 a few weeks later only to find that there were problems for other new users. Again none of this was caught by us or Apple. As they say, shit happens. We quickly put together a release and submitted it to Apple about 6 weeks ago.

A 6 week delay does seem both unreasonable and shit, although in the grand scheme of App Store disasters it's the longest individual delay I've heard of (which, unscientifically, hopefully makes it an anomaly and a mistake, rather than symptomatic of the broken-in-so-many-other-ways review process).

What this scenario really sounds like, is another strong case for Craig Hockenberry's proposed use of limited [DTS incident-style tickets](http://furbo.org/2009/06/15/brain-farts/) to promote App approvals in cases of high-priority patching.
