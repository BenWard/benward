If you attended Cupcake Camp today in San Francisco (and let's face it, you should have done; it was delicious) you may have wondered between mouthfuls of cake and icing “Just what _are_ these splendid and eclectic tunes accompanying my noshing?”—or a thought transcript to that effect.

I'm glad you asked. I've uploaded a PDF, printed out of iTunes. You can [see it here](http://benward.me/files/Cupcake-Camp-Playlist.pdf). Remember when WinAMP used to have an export as HTML button? Yeah. Those days are gone.

I submitted it as an iTunes iMix too [You can view it here](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewIMix?id=334641037 "Open iMix in iTunes"), but only about 60% of the music is in iTunes, so it's not complete.
