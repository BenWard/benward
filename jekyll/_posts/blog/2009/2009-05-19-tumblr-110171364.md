[Clarke](http://scraplab.net/2009/05/19/clarke-an-osx-fire-eagle-updater.html) by [Tom Taylor](http://tomtaylor.co.uk/) is a fantastic little Mac OSX application for updating your Fire Eagle location by proximity to nearby wireless networks. It uses Skyhook â€” same as the iPhone Location Services.

It's lightweight, pretty, and works automatically. Perfect!
