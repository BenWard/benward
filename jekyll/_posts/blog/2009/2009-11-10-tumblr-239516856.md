As is their way, The Boston Globe has a stunning set of photographs commemorating the fall of the Berlin wall.

(My memory of the event (at the age of 5) was of [Timmy Mallett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timmy_Mallett) explaining it on [Wacaday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacaday)â€”I guess it must have been the Autumn half-term break of 1989. I have an unshakable, vivid recollection of him hammering the wall with that giant yellow and pink rubber mallet. YouTube does not have the video.)
