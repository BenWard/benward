> For instance, when posting a Flickr photo from a user directly, “via” should really be “by”. Using “via” only makes sense when you’re giving someone credit for introducing you to content and to link back to them as thanks. Even in those cases, however, it’s inappropriate to remove the creator credit on the item.

Garrett Murray on the misuse of ‘via’ for creator attribution on Tumblr (see also: Twitter.) An issue close to my heart that I've not been able to put into a concise combination of words.

That said, I don't like using ‘by’ in place of ‘via’ either. There's something clumsy in the aesthetic of the statement ‘By Tim’. Perhaps there aren't enough syllables. Personally, I'm happy using the em-dash for credits.
