Fifty People, One Question: London on Vimeo (via <a href="http://vimeo.com/2834087">Vimeo</a>)

It's inevitably upsetting seeing the place I called home set in beautiful shifting focus to emotive piano soundtrack (from the start to 2'00, and again from 5'45 to the end). I didn't think watching video of a pavement near the South Bank would have me crying this year, though.

I don't think that London is glamourous, or glitzy, nor is it the sunshine-drenched paradise that San Francisco presents. But it's very real. It's home to a more diverse, interesting community of people than anywhere I know of in the world. Everybody there is lively; alive in a way that's always incredibly different from the next person you see.

I do miss it very much.
