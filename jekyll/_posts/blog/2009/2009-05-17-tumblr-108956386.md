> European pressing: Near the inner groove of the Outside is etched in script: "This is the way" and the Inside has "Step". Both lines are taken from the song "Atrocity Exhibition", which was released on the follow up Closer album, a year later.

Sat up at 1:30am listening to Joy Division's ‘Closer’ again and got curious as to its precise age. Incredibly, Joy Division's albums (being only a year apart in release) are about to turn 30 years old. Wow.
