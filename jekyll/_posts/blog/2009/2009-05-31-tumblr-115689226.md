This ‘Britain's Got Talent’ has, thankfully passed me by, thanks to being in the US. There appears to be a programme here called ‘America's Got Talent’, but I don't watch television to know whether it's a real programme or scheduled broadcast for penis enlargement pills. Regardless, they wouldn't let any ugly people on stage here, so there's no chance it's the same.

Apparently that Susan Boyle was on Oprah. Again with the not watching television.

_Aaaanyway_, everything you and I never needed to know about this Simon Cowell Ego Vehicle has now been covered by Gareth of Los Campesinos in a style that I approve of.
