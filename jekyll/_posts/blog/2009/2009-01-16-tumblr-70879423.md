> The elimination of Thursdays forces a change to Thankgsiving.

<cite><a href="http://tantek.pbwiki.com/NewCalendar">Tantek Çelik — ‘NewCalendar’</a></cite>

Faced with both a burgeoning microformats task list and an irresistible desire to procrastinate, Tantek has apparently spent most of the past <abbr title='bi-month'>bim</abbr> fixing time itself.

Rather fascinating summary into the formation of the calendar, months and weeks along with a more mathematically perfect calendar that pretty much makes sense in every way. In fact, the only really jarring issue I have with Tantek's work here is the ‘New Monday’ naming convention he adopts.

Perhaps it's an easier development issue to cope with for me, since I wouldn't have to change the date of my birthday.
