> Knowing the top speed of a car doesn't tell you how fast you can drive in rush hour. To actually see the difference in page loads between all three browsers, you need slow-motion video. This one’s also a tie.

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/get-the-facts/browser-comparison.aspx">Windows Internet Explorer 8: Get the facts
</a> is a marketing exercise from Microsoft that's so very, very full of shit it cannot pass unridiculed.

Lies, mistruths and opinion stated as fact throughout, the most hilarious case is the above, where it writhes around IEs reputation for appallingly slow JavaScript performance with claims of ‘a tie’.

Honestly, with their appalling ‘$10,000 IE8-only web page’ promo earlier in the week, and the… [slightly odd… Dean Cain (seriously) promos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjUzzxAKs20), their marketing machine appear to be trying to cluster-bomb their way back into the market.
