Some time ago I picked up some new personal domains, [benward.me](http://benward.me) and [bnwrd.me](http://bnwrd.me). I'd somewhat dismissed the <code>.me</code> <abbr title='top level domain'>TLD</abbr>, but as time goes on and the opportunity to claim <samp>benward.com</samp> seems distant, I've decided to switch over.

I spend a certain amount of time thinking about what makes a good URL, and the old [ben-ward.co.uk](http://ben-ward.co.uk) set-up has a number of problems.

* Country affiliation, even though I'm fairly nation non-specific at this point
* The United Kingdom registration system requires that the <code>.uk</code> <abbr>TLD</abbr> be prefixed by <code>.co</code>.
* The hyphen was clumsy, it's difficult to pronounce to people, and people keep going to <samp>benward.co.uk</samp> instead, which isn't me.
* The result out loud was “ben-dash-ward-dot-co-dot-uk”. Clumsy.
* People unfamiliar with the UK also hear the initial “.co” and assume that's going to be “.com”, or “.com.uk”. It's really not a very good domain name.

So, with my pair of <code>.me</code> domains in hand, I can gladly switch to a nice simple “benward.me” whenever someone needs it out loud, and confusion is forever gone.

<code>benward.me</code> and <code>bnwrd.me</code> are also siblings in the <code>.me</code> <abbr>TLD</abbr>, so when the latter is used for short URLs to the expanded, vowelled-up[*](#me-footnote) version, the transformation will be smoother, too.

_Of course_, all the old domains work, hurtling you around the internets with <code>301</code> redirects. Apparently this means I won't get destroyed by Google, too. We'll see.

One other semantic change I made whilst doing all this tweaking, is to move this Scattered Mind blog onto [blog.benward.me](http://blog.benward.me), dropping this whole <code>micro</code> nonsense. It turns out that ‘microblogging’ is… blogging. And so, the domain is fixed. Again, [micro.ben-ward.co.uk](http://micro.ben-ward.co.uk) will <code>301</code> redirect over to the new sub-domain, although it's taking a little time for the DNS to update.

<p id="me-footnote">* Yes, I said ‘vowelled-up’. ‘vowelled-down’ is going to be my new way of describing Web 2.0 branding.</p>
