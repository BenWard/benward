> You can paint it any color you want, but the broadest concept fueling the web is the exchange of knowledge and data over the network, and to argue that web apps are somehow ‘exempt’ from the need to ensure accessibility because they are somehow different does the real disservice here – they are simply more complex abstract layers between the data and the user.

<cite>John Foliot</cite> <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/337/the-cost-of-accessibility#c005009">commenting on ‘The Cost of Accessibility’</a> at [Drew's blog](http://allinthehead.com/retro/337/the-cost-of-accessibility). I think he absolutely nails it: *Content is king*, no matter what context you present it in.

My contribution to the web applications frameworks discussion is not especially refined at this point, tends to be ranty and as such not as useful as I think it should be. Sorry about that.

We have to ensure something constructive comes out this discussion. We can't keep doing it every time someone releases a new framework. I think there's a very important discussion to be had, and a great opportunity to establish reasonable expectations of web frameworks.

For example, it's my _expectation_ that if I could afford the time to implement Objective-<em>fucking</em>-C in client-side JavaScript, I could afford the time use to use a `<button>` element in the right place, too.

Oh. Being constructive. Right. That wasn't a good example.
