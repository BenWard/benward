> Unfortunately I let that emotion get the best of me and I reacted by speaking out during the President’s speech. I should not have disrespected the President by responding in that manner.
> But I am not sorry for fighting back against the dangerous policies of liberal Democrats. America’s working families deserve to have their views represented in Washington, and I will do so with civility. But I will not back down.

So wait. You are or you aren't sorry for an outrageous disrespect of your country's democratic institutions and the office of President? Because I'm pretty sure you said you were, and then every time you've opened your mouth since then you're sounding less and less like you mean it. And this time you're asking for money, too. Something about that seems… very insincere.
