> It's astounding the White House cannot distinguish between news and opinion programming

<cite class='vcard'><span class='fn'>Michael Clemente</span>, <span class='org'>Fox News</span></cite>

[Tonight and every weeknight on Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/fnctv/):

> 5:00pm: Glenn Beck
> 8:00pm: Bill O'Reilly
> 9:00pm: Sean Hannity

There are some (allegedly) straight news shows mixed in with those blowhards. But, if I may quote [my favourite Talking Points Memo comment](http://tpmlivewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/09/hurt-feelings-at-fox-news.php#comment-3607999) of all time:

> You live in their house, [Chris] Wallace. Don't expect everyone to come to your parties.
