Safari, you're great. You and I hang out all the time and since you got that update that stops the random crashing, we're getting along _great_. Much better than I ever did with Firefox, that crazy ‘render your page a little differently every time your reload’ _bitch_.

Thing is, I maxed out my MacBook Pro with 4GB of RAM. That RAM was for _me_ so that I can do important work, like running you and Windows, and Ubuntu, and OmniGraffle and Fireworks and Photoshop all at the same time. And I know we've got this whole ‘what's mine is yours what's yours is mine’ _thing_, but moving your fat arse into _700 MEG_ of my new RAM? That's way more than cheeky; you're being unreasonable.

You have to _learn to share_ this machine with some other programmes. They're not as pretty as you, and some of them are way too demanding, and I know that Adobe Updater keeps telling me to quit on you; he's a total dick. But please, stay calm and play a little nicer with everyone.

Also, stop eating my cookies.
