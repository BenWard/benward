> As you know, we are committed to delivering quality game experiences on Xbox LIVE and Games for Windows – LIVE. After receiving reports of errors with the Fallout 3 Game Add-on Broken Steel on Games for Windows – LIVE, our technical team removed the file from Games for Windows – LIVE Marketplace and worked to quickly resolve the issue.

This example provided by the Microsoft Gaming division, forcing the phrase ‘Games for Windows - LIVE’ into [Major Nelson's blog](http://majornelson.com/archive/2009/05/07/fallout-3-broken-steel-fixed.aspx) four too many times..

How much of your cerebral cortex has to be flaking off to take responsible for this butchery of communication?
