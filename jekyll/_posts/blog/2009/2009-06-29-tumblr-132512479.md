> Apple and other big phone makers have struck a deal with the European Commission to start selling phones with universal cell phone chargers starting next year.

I find it especially interesting that a mere two years after shipping, “Apple” is the big-name manufacturer and everyone else is just “others”.

The news itself is excellent, too: mobile phones standardising on micro-USB for charging means we can kiss proprietary chargers farewell next year.
