> Promote your message via YouTube if you want to. But it is no substitute for knocking on doors or setting up a stall in the town centre.

<cite><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8096833.stm">Hazel Blears</a>, Labour <abbr title="Member of Parliament">MP</abbr></cite>

Blears not only made a fool of herself and destabilised her party by resigning days before the election, but also demonstrates here that she's completely out of touch with modern communications.

I'm not saying that getting out on the streets isn't still very, very important in stimulating political participation, but downplaying the net? It's as if the Obama campaign has completely passed her by.
