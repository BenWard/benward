> And don’t get me started on the whole “you don’t need to know html/css/js” malarky – it’s akin to calling yourself a graphic designer using PowerPoint and clipart.

<cite>[David Emery](http://de-online.co.uk/2009/02/25/cappuccino-is-not-designed-for-building-web-sites)</cite>, in response to [me](http://micro.ben-ward.co.uk/post/81235921) regarding that whole Cappuccino framework thing last month. Missed this rather fine quote at the time.

Quoted now as a small prompt to conclude an ‘Expectations of Web Frameworks’ post that I've had in draft in for over a month. If you too would like to see it finished more quickly, or think you've got something I should include in a so-titled [blog](http://ben-ward.co.uk) post, please hassle me.
