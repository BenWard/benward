*[Ben Ward on Skitch](http://skitch.com/benward/)*

Like everyone on earth, I have a skitch account. Apparently I hardly ever used it. Or maybe I actually have two accounts and some wealth of older posting is lost to the internet somewhere. Doesn't matter. I've started posting UI rants and observations there. For now. Whether it's the right tool for the job (as opposed to Tumblr, or Flickr) remains to be seen.
