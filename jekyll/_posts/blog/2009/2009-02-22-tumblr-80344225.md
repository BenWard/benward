> You can sense his frustration amid a scandal that was essentially cooked up by Consumerist on the Sunday night of a holiday weekend without even calling Facebook to check if their assumptions on the Terms of Use changes were right.

<cite>Sarah Lacy</cite>, writing for TechCrunch (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/21/facebook-you-own-all-your-data-period-but-see-you-at-the-next-privacy-uproar/">Facebook: You Own All Your Data. Period. (But See You at the Next Privacy Uproar.) </a>).

Yes, it must have be _very_ frustrating for Facebook to have a blog cook something up like that. Without calling, even! Nothing at all like cooking up a scandal about Last.FM, last thing on Friday night, without verifying anything. Nothing like that _at all_.

I promise this is my last TechCrunch-shitting post. The self-parody is getting too much for me to handle.
