I'm very impressed with [Four Square](http://playfoursquare.com). Although I don't actively use it to keep up with my friends, it remains quite fun. Certainly as good a way as any to advertise my whereabouts at times when I want to be found. 

My critical experiences of using Four Square at SXSW this year, perhaps not 100% successful:

> OK! We've got you at Ceder Street Courtyard. And we suspect some fake-checkins / cheating… 0 points!

This was bullshit. I did not cheat. Go to hell, game.

And then, we were unable to jump the queue for South By North West, even though I was the mayor of the Iron Cactus. I don't remember very much of that night. Other than: I didn't eat anything, and people gave me lots of beer for free. You know that feeling you have when you think something terrible might have happened that you've scraped from your memory? Me too.

> Apparently being the fucking mayor of the the [sic] fucking iron cactus is not enough  to jump the queue. FTW [sic] foursquare!?

I never thought I'd have to ‘[sic]’ myself. Although after a night of heavy drinking, that can be a predictable outcome.
