*[Millions spent by lobbyists fighting Obama health reforms - guardian.co.uk
	](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/oct/01/lobbyists-millions-obama-healthcare-reform)*

The Guardian (and sister paper The Observer) provide as good or better summary coverage of the United States than the US media does. A few key details generalised here (like the specifics of which Senate committee is involved), but still excellent. The comments seem to be rather more intelligent too.
