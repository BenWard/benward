In a continuation of my euphoria over the [Los Campesinos](http://www.loscampesinos.com) show at Slim's last night, here's ‘We Throw Parties, You Throw Knives’, which you can in fact download for free from their website. It's a few years old, and they didn't even play it at the show, but the chorus is still cracking.
