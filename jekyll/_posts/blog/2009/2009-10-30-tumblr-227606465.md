Apparently choosing which edition of Windows is right for you is still as confusing as ever. 

(Ultimate Edition remains the ‘oh fuck it I have no idea what any of this means, just take my Goddamn money and let this be over now’ choice. When my parents got Windows Vista a few years back, we originally plumped for Home Premium, only to find that some piece of the networking subsystem was disabled, preventing Dad from connecting to his work VPN. So we had to Ultimate Edition anyway. Incidentally, ‘Anytime Upgrade’, for those short of hard disc space at the time, means ‘reinstall from scratch’.)
