> Yes, it’s true that a team at Google couldn’t decide between two blues, so they’re testing 41 shades between each blue to see which one performs better. I had a recent debate over whether a border should be 3, 4 or 5 pixels wide, and was asked to prove my case. I can’t operate in an environment like that. I’ve grown tired of debating such miniscule design decisions. There are more exciting design problems in this world to tackle.

<cite class='vcard'><a class='fn url' href='http://stopdesign.com/'>Doug Bowman</a></cite> in <a href="http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html">Goodbye Google</a>.

For all my armchair criticism of Google's ghastly look & feel, clunky icons and incessant rejection of using the right HTML elements in the right places, I never would have imagined it could be this broken inside.

Best of luck to Doug. He was there at the forefront of the web standards community when I graduated into this world that defines my career and my life, and he was quite inspiring. His voice and contribution has been missed during the Google years.
