> Fireworks CS4: Disabled the retarded tabbed interface, then went to open 10 images to drag into my site design… <strong>OH LOOK THEY ALL OPEN FULL FUCKING SCREEN</strong>.

Adobe UI Gripes, my new favourite use of Tumblr and British cursing. There are some absolutely amazing errors and quirks in play as Adobe attempt to rebuild native Mac UI from scratch.

Can we just get an Apple-produced Creativity Suite already? iCreate — a new productivity suite containing all new products ‘Pixels’, ‘Vectors’ and… oh, yeah, that's all we actually needed, thanks.
