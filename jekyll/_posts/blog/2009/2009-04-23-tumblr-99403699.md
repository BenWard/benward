> Obviously I wont pay, alternative to last.fm?

<cite>“EU Citizen 2482”</cite>

Last.FM have had to start charging to stream music to parts of the globe that can't be supported through on-site advertising. It hurts and sure, the situation sucks a bit for all involved. But it breaks my heart to see the foaming reactions of these spoiled, freeloading shitbags and their oh-so-precious senses of entitlement.

Comment after comment of abuse, nonsense and vitriol directed at wonderful people. A lot has been [written](http://log.maniacalrage.net/post/98510137/) lately about the kind of user you don't really want. But through nothing else but being great, Last.FM have apparently acquired the kinds of users you don't want to share a planet with, let alone a web service.

They are ‘users’ in every worst sense.
