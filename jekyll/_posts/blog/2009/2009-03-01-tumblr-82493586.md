# [Olly Moss](http://www.ollymoss.com)

Olly Moss is an artist in England, and through a slightly convoluted trail of web browsing, I found his work twice in a week through entire separate endeavours. [His portfolio](http://www.ollymoss.com/) is amazing, and I advise trawling through it. 

I stumbled across Olly's work first last week. I was catching up on [spacesick's](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spacesick/) brilliant and hilarious [‘I can read movies’ series](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spacesick/sets/72157614482499746/), and noted that his inspiration was Olly Moss’ [Films in Red and Black](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ollym/sets/72157607801959609/) series. Both sets are brilliant.

Anyway. Then in an act of procrastination I was trawling [Threadless](http://threadless.com), since I've not bought anything from them in a while. Found [Ticket to Ride](http://www.threadless.com/product/1292/Ticket_To_Ride). Want it and may buy it. Clicked on the artist's link… it's the very same Olly Moss. The man is prolific.

The portfolio is full of amazing gems. I particularly love the ‘Videogame Classics’ series of video game cover-art reimaginings, but, really, I like it all.

I don't think I'd normally go off on on such gushing praise for a stumbling on a great page like this, but the circumstances of finding his work twice just struck me.

Both Olly and Spacesick are taking part in [Make Something Cool Every Day](http://www.flickr.com/groups/1012163@N22/pool/), which is a rather wonderful thing. I think I'd like to do it, but I really don't have the artistic depth. Maybe I'll try anyway.
