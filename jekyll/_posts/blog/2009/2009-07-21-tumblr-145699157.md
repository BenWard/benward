Another case of Facebook appearing strangely insensitive around break-ups. [Previously](http://blog.benward.me/post/123305913) I highlighted the ability of your contacts to ‘Like’ your break-up activity, this time someone's new single status is a ‘Highlight’ of my day.

Some of this stems from the collision of generic or ambiguous terms, but even so, it still seems really _odd_ to promote sad events like this across the network in such a blanket, raw fashion.
