> The real question Americans are asking is, 'What has President Obama actually accomplished?' It is unfortunate that the president's star power has outshined tireless advocates who have made real achievements working towards peace and human rights. One thing is certain - President Obama won't be receiving any awards from Americans for job creation, fiscal responsibility, or backing up rhetoric with concrete action.

<cite>Michael Steele</cite>

Indeed, the American people would never award President Obama anything. I mean, apart from the Presidency. Which they elected him to with a large majority, less than a year ago. Which is kinda like an award, if you think about it. _If_ you think about it. I mean, you _do_ think before you open your mouth, don't you Michael Steele?

Remember: _Real Americans_ cheer when their country loses a bid to host the Olympics, and jeer when their country wins a prestigious award for world peace. It's a confusing new rule, I have to admit.
