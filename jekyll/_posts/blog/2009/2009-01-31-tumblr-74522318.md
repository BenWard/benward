> Perhaps the most significant conclusion we can make from these survey results is that there is no typical screen reader user. As developers, we sometimes view screen reader accessibility as JAWS or Window Eyes or VoiceOver (or whatever) compatibility. This survey emphasizes that screen reader accessibility is about real people - and people that have diverse abilities and preferences. As developers, we must do our best to accommodate the needs of this diverse group.

Incredible study into actual screen reader usage reveals a complex, varied world. This is important, because it actually gives developers without a hint of a disability something concrete to grasp when trying to comprehend these needs. We can't imagine what it's like to depend on a screen reader, so research like this brings us closer to comprehension.
