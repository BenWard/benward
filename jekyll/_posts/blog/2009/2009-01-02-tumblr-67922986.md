Today I'm travelling back to San Francisco. I had a great week with my family and friends back in London, but I'm looking forward to getting back.

It's going to be a long day. I fly at 9:00 to Toronto, and then have a five hour stopover before making it to to San Francisco. Gonna be tired.

Sunday brunch?
