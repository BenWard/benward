> It also features a bit of a novel subscription feature, where you can pay £35 and get everything that’s released for the rest of the year (including the album, several 7“s and an EP) and a load of extras.

New subscription feature for all of [God Help The Girl](http://godhelpthegirl.com/)'s output this year. Very clever, and rewarding for fans.
