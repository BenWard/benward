*[My Saved Items from Fever (RSS Feed)](http://feed.benapps.net/?rss=saved)*

[Fever](http://feedafever.com) just got an update and now includes options to export saved items as an RSS feed.

Useful in its own right, this is especially cool as you can use other people's Saved Items as Sparks in your own Fever instance, socially promoting interesting content.

It's not the driving purpose behind Fever, but I think it's got a lot of potential as a first class demonstration of a distributed, socially connected web application. And all built on feeds. But RSS is dead, right?
