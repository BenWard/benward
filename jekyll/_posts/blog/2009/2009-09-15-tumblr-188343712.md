> Billionaires for Wealthcare is a grassroots network of health insurance CEOs, industry lobbyists, talk-show hosts, and others profiting off of our broken health care system.
> 
> We are not a political, religious or even particularly well-organized group. We're simple folk, thrilled profiteers pouring out of our corner offices to dance on the grave of "Change.

This is both the most brilliantly awesome thing ever, and embarrassing for humanity.

I'm unsure where I stand on taking advantage of these people that have already been taken advantage of once by Glenn Beck and his ilk. There must be a limit at which your own lazy disengagement from society and, well, _reading_ really does mean you must take responsibility for being somebody's tool. I find them unforgivably ignorant. I'm pretty sure that alarmingly full-of-shit movements like the [9-12 project](http://www.the912project.com) is over that limit.
