I [linked to](http://blog.benward.me/post/184936610) my exciting new [Fever ‘Saved Items’ feed](http://feed.benapps.net/?rss=saved) before, but the thought occurs that I could link to my various other feeds of affection as well, so here they are.

Would love to know if people actual consume any of these, and how, and what they get from them. I don't necessarily mean just mine; I mean anyone's. It's the concept of following favourite items that interests me (I think it's a sorely neglected form of vitality).

So, if the order that I remember them:

  * [Saved items from Feeds](http://feed.benapps.net/?rss=saved) (feed from [Fever](http://feedafever.com))
  * [Favourite videos on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=BenWardcouk&view=favorites)
  * [Favourite tweets](http://twitter.com/BenWard/favorites)
  * [‘Liked’ video on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/benward/likes)
  * [‘Liked’ items on Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/liked/by/benw) (now neglected in favour of Fever)
  * [Loved tracks on Last.FM](http://www.last.fm/user/Shovel/library/loved)
  * [Loved tracks on Hype Machine](http://hypem.com/BenWard)
  * [Favourite photographs on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/benward/favorites)
  * [Ffffound images](http://ffffound.com/home/benward/found/)
  * [Bookmarks on Delicious](http://del.icio.us/benward)
