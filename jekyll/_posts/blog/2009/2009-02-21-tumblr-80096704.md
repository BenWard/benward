> I'd like to issue a full and categorical denial of this. We've never had any request for such data by anyone, and if we did we wouldn't consent to it. Of course we work with the major labels and provide them with broad statistics, as we would with any other label, but we'd never personally identify our users to a third party - that goes against everything we stand for. As far as I'm concerned Techcrunch have made this whole story up.

Nice to see that ‘amateur hour’ is still in full swing at TechCrunch. Valleywag is dead, here's hoping TechCrunch is next on Karma's hit list.
