Something which I would be most upset about looking back on the future history of the internet is if those who only see the visual presentation of web pages win. If the combined ignorance of many should cause the semantic beauty of the web to be lost, for the <code>abbr</code>s and <code>blockquotes</code>s of the world to disappear into irrelevance. Then, the web will be a far less interesting place.

A tool with which we can describe our writing with subtlety and depth, and make it more than just words written on a page is precious and it's up to the combined enlightenment of us, the ones who really get it, to make sure that the we don't give it up.
