> Indeed, the common manifesto among this new wave of coffee shop owners is that they wanted to bring a slice of Sydney or Auckland to London. But recently, it's not only Antipodeans that are doing this - Brits who have experienced first-hand the amazing coffee culture in Australia and New Zealand have come back determined to recreate the experience for their fellow citizens.

Fabulous article ‘[Drinking Coffee in London](http://www.timeout.com/london/connect/food+drink/blog/83/raising-the-bar-the-independent-cafes-and-antipodean-attitudes-regenerating-our-coffee-cul)’, on the capital's resurgent coffee culture. Published in Time Out back in July. (Pictured is Ben Townsend of The Espresso Room)
