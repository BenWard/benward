> Regarding <code>class</code>. The comment that ‘Class attributes are meant to store machine information according to the W3C specs’ is completely incorrect, and is a suggestion that comes up over and over again. So: 
> 
> The HTML4 spec says, in <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#h-7.5.2'>§7.5.2 on <code>id</code> and <code>class</code> attributes</a>: “The <code>class</code> attribute, on the other hand, assigns one or more class names to an element; the element may be said to belong to these classes.”
> 
> Below, it says that class may be used for stylesheet selectors, and ‘For general purpose processing by user agents.’
> 
> That ‘general purpose’ statement is wildly and regularly misinterpreted as allowing class to contain arbitrary data, even though that use contradicts the ‘belong to these classes’ specification. <em>A data value is not a classification</em>. Further clarifying this, under the spec for the <code>id</code> attribute in the same section, ‘general purpose processing’ is defined more fully: 
> 
> ‘For general purpose processing by user agents (e.g. for identifying fields when extracting data from HTML pages into a database, translating HTML documents into other formats, etc.).’
> 
> Thus, <code>class</code> is for classifying elements and for identifying fields (which is exactly what microformats does with it). Those things taken together, I don’t see how the spec can be read as permitting data itself to be valid within the class attribute.
> 
> Even if you disagree with my assertion that the ‘machine form’ is content, <code>class</code> is still an invalid place to stick it.

A snippet of a comment I posted on <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2009/microformats-accessibility-html-5-again/">Bruce Lawson's ‘Microformats, accessibility, HTML 5 (again)’</a>. The suggest that we just munge everything into the <code>class</code> attribute keeps coming up, so wanted my latest rebuke of that idea preserved for posterity; I'm sure I'll need it again.
