A few years ago I worked on a Mac OSX dashboard widget called [Twitgit](http://ben-ward.co.uk/widgets/twitgit). This was in the earlier days of Twitter clients — I'm not even sure that [Twitterrific](http://twitterrific.com/) had been released yet — and John Gruber [gave me some linkage](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2006/12/01/twitget-05).

Today, Gruber [linked to _himself_](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/04/29/twitter-told-you-so), as a pat on the bat for predicting the rise of Twitter. That post links to me, and even though it's two years old and buried two links deep (if you're reading through RSS), my traffic still doubled.

That Gruber bloke? Kinda a big deal.
