I'm laying in bed, flat on my back without pillows because I'm trying not to put any weird strain on my neck, having spent the day in some pain.

It's not very comfortable.

I can feel the tension across my shoulders, and I long for someone to reach out and touch them, and make all the muscles relax at once.

Trouble is, I don't know who could do that any more.
