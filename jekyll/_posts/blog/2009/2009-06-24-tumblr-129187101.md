Another revision of Microsoft Office, a second attempt by web designers at having Word's HTML renderer ripped out. This regression was initially introduced in Office 2007, as Microsoft had a problem with HTML composed in Word looking different when rendered using Outlook's (then) Trident (Internet Explorer) powered preview-pane. Their solution was to render using Word, rather than IE.

It's almost like… if only there were… what if there was some sort of _standard_ for rendering HTML? The different teams inside Microsoft could both adhere to it… and then… no… that would never work.

Although I suspect it's all in vain, and I couldn't really give a shit about the cause of HTML email anyway, this campaign has been _stunningly_ Twitter enabled. Super-impressive page.
