Gabe and Tycho are running a series of standalone comics with a view to producing a full storyline later in the year. [Today's Automata comic](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2009/6/12/) is just _beautiful_. 

> Beginning today, projecting through Friday and culminating on Monday, we will offer you one page "treatments" of three comics which differ radically from our usual output. Next week, we'll get a poll up to determine which one you'd like to see us investigate further. Then, later this summer - during the San Diego Comic Con would be my guess - we'll upload a storyline based on what the metamind has chosen.
