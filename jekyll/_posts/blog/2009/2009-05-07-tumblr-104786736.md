Whilst on the subject of pretend plastic musical instruments, here's a counterpoint from the staying-classy camp of rhythm games. Harmonix and MTV Games have released a picture of the guitars for Rock Band: The Beatles later in the year.

Will anyone actually buy them given that they already own Rock Band in some other form? Yeah. Probably not. _But_, the attention to detail is quite gorgeous. That, even within this strange sub-genre of pretending-to-be-in-a-band-when-you're-drunk, someone is taking pride.
