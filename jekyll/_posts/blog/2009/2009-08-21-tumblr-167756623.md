[Nick Douglas has reached the point of realisation](http://toomuchnick.com/post/167706635/why-cant-i-read-all-my-blogs-on-tumblr) that Tumblr is a better feed reader UI than others. Where, at this point in history, ‘others’ is pretty much Google Reader. He wants the ability to read other feeds in Tumblr.

I've gone the other way. I no-longer read Tumblr posts in Tumblr itself, instead all my Tumblr subscriptions go into [Fever](http://feedafever.com). I loved reading in Tumblr because it blew Google Reader out of the water in terms of legibility and, well, _joy_. But Fever does that too, and is, of course, open to reading the whole web, not just the strange blogging bubble of Tumblr.

Fever has the ability to save/fave posts. What it currently lacks is a way to distribute them outside. Someone wrote an Atom feed hack for it, which is a good start, but a full API would be better. I miss being able to click the heart on people's posts here, and if I could have Fever cascade that info back into Tumblr, that would be pretty great. There's a scripting challenge ahead.
