I love [The Daily Mash](http://www.thedailymash.co.uk), ever since I discovered [their piece on US Healthcare](http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/international/americans-without-health-insurance-attack-plan-to-give-them-health-insurance-200908141981/).

I'm also unashamedly a little sad that [Oasis finally split up](http://www.oasisinet.com/NewsArticle.aspx?n=773). They were a relevant piece of my childhood. To top it off, [Definitely Maybe is 15 years old today](http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/08/31/oasis-definitely-maybe-turns-15-as-fans-mourn-gallaghers-split/)—holy fuck.
