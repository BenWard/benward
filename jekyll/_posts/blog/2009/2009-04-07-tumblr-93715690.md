I try to refresh my avatar once a year. I want to timeshift it as near to the new year as possible, so each one lasts about 10 months now.

Sticking with the tint, since I think that's become a fairly important visual aid in recognising me online (David Recordon recently greeted me with ‘You're far less yellow in real life’), but zooming out a bit and allowing a little more detail to creep in.

Expect me to be lazy about updating websites to use the new icon.
