All right. I appreciate that Guitar Hero's plastic guitar controllers probably seemed more absurd on initial launch than they do now, five sequels and a rival brand later. But. Honestly? DJ Hero? _Really_? _Really_?

Apparently along with upcoming Metallica, Van Halen and ‘Best of’ (no, seriously) releases of Guitar Hero, there's _another_ sequel penned in for later in the year.

Every time I see Guitar Hero news I feel happiness for the Harmonix team for jumping ship at the right time. Someone remind me, where's the line between ‘exploitation’ and ‘rape’ of a franchise?
