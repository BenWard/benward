> Video For Everybody is very simply a chunk of HTML code that embeds a video into a website using the HTML5 `<video>` element which offers native playback in Firefox 3.5 and Safari 3 & 4: This is native OGG video playback in Firefox 3.5 (you get MPEG4 / H.264 playback in Safari). No plugins to install.
> 
> In other browsers that do not support `<video>`, it falls back to Adobe Flash.

Awesome, if complex, HTML-only pattern for using the new `video` element in HTML5 with fallbacks for all other browsers. Although, as it stands, it requires some amount of duplicate encoding (H.264 for Mac, OGG Theora for Firefox). Good stuff though.
