Prelude is the system font commissioned for the new Palm Pre, designed by David Berlow of Font Bureau.

One of the defining features of both the iPhone and Palm Pre, in their position at the head of this new generation of high-resolution, high-density display devices is the effort that goes into typography. Apple went for the well established, never-fails Helvetica, Palm have tried to differentiate themselves with something new. Both use it to great effect and it gives both the iPhone and Pre an air of class. 

Other phones I've seen neglect the quality of text (or are simply been unable to do more, due to low resolution screens.)
