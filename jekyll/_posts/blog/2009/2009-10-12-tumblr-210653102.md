Google's approach to the web continues to frustrate me immensely. On the one hand, many of their developers are at the forefront of pushing HTML5, SVG and other fantastic technologies and doing great work to bring them to users sooner. But on the other hand, they continually release products that discard established good practice of web development.

Nothing about this filter mechanism needs to depend on JavaScript. The users in the comments complaining that they can't access this functionality on their perfectly adequate Blackberry handsets and are well within their rights to feel shafted.

I know it's small, but stuff like this undermines the web. No matter how sophisticated and application-like we make our interfaces, it's the sharing on information that matters most.
