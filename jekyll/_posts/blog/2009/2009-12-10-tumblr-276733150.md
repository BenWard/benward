> For Mac users who want to use their favorite text editor everywhere. QuickCursor allows you to edit text from any application in your favorite text editor

Very cool. Old extensions (generally just for web browsers) would enable ‘Edit in TextMate’ functions for text areas, but this tries to go further.
