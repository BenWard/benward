<cite>[Pixelmator](http://pixelmator.com)</cite>

After initiating a download of Pixelmator, the page blacks out and offers you a friendly confirmation dialog, and the ‘should be available on your Mac shortly’ message creates a nice bridge between the web environment and the environment of your computer. It's quite gorgeous.

I think the concept could be extended further, actually, perhaps the ‘Drag to Applications’ installation guide, links into the ‘Get Started’ tutorial, or screencasts could be linked in; engaging the user whilst they wait for the download to finish. In fact, I'd love to see a (useful) screencast of approximately the same length of time as the software download itself. Engage the user from the moment you click; that's slick.
