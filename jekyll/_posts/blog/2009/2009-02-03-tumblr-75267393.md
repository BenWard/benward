I'm working on adding a wiki system to my personal site for non-chronological content. I hinted at doing this a while ago in [Practical Publishing](http://ben-ward.co.uk/blog/practical-publishin/). It's taken until now to actually get it together.

I've ended up going with [MediaWiki](http://mediawiki.org) since it's what I know, shares the same PHP language as my blog (running on Wordpress) and does everything I want. I also feel pretty good working with the core code to improve it (expect a fork or patch project on [my github page](http://github.com/benward) soon).

Anyway, there's an interesting thing about its [advice with regard to URLs](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Short_URL), which boils down to strongly discouraging having wiki pages served from the root of a domain, and instead having it one level deep (e.g. <samp>/wiki/<samp> on [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org)).

I think this is wrong in the context of personal publishing

‘wiki’ says nothing about the content. Whilst <samp>/blog/</samp> relates to the _kind_ of content provided, ‘wiki’ is a fact about my publishing platform. Certainly on a personal site, where the collaborative aspect of wiki culture won't be available to a visitor, it's a misleading fragment. So, <samp>ben-ward.co.uk/wiki/about</samp> is out.

Now, the reason to try and heed the MediaWiki advice is quite simple; the top level of my site is already shared between different systems. [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) powers my blog, [Mint](http://haveamint.com) runs my stats and there are some directories of static content too. To run wiki URLs at the top level of my site I either have to run thorough exclusion rules to make sure my static content and expected top level items aren't overridden, or do the opposite and create a whitelisted structure of wiki pages. Either way, whenever I add content to the wiki or the static structure, I have to edit the apache config and restart. It's not ideal.

As such, it's worth considering a URL structure that does keep the wiki separated from other systems. But what? Everything I think of comes over as redundant:

  * <samp>/content</samp> is entirely redundant. Not much better than the <samp>/html/</samp> paths that some sites used to sport.
  * <samp>/pages</samp>
  * <samp>/articles</samp> misleadingly restricts the content type

Really, what I'm publishing is _my website_. Unless I'm missing something really obvious, melding it together into the top level seems to be the only option that makes sense.
