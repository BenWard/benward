> And from that, we come to the headline. <strong>Food is not fuel</strong>. Not to be misconstrued as an anti-biofuels slogan, this is about valuing everything you eat. Savouring the taste of every mouthful. If you’re just filling up, what’s the point? Food is not about nutrition, or fat, or calories or traffic light diets. Food is about pleasure.

Some time ago, in a country far, far away, my friend David and I started a food blog. We registered an awesome domain name, threw together some header graphics, wrote a few entries, and proceeded to fail dismally at launching it.

Time passes.

With a kick of motivation, I've tried to bring our blog back to life. So I urge you to go read [munchmun.ch](http://munchmun.ch): a blog about food.
