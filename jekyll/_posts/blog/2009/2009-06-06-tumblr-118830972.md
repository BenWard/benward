> A new monthly event for Bay Area designers to share ideas, learn, and get things done.
> Â 
> Chromatic combines the spirit and goals of developer-oriented events like hackathons and hackerspaces with the practical structure needed for designers and students of design to truly learn, receive feedback, and improve their design skills by talking with their peers.

<p>Awesome new design event from <cite class='organizer vcard'><a class='url' href='http://www.heather-rasley.com/'><abbr class='fn' title='Heather Rasley'>Heather</abbr></a></cite>, <cite class='organizer vcard'><a class='url'  href='http://timoni.org/'><abbr class='fn' title='Timoni Grone'>Timoni</abbr></a></cite> and <cite class='organizer vcard'><a class='url' href='http://thegreattiny.blogspot.com/'><abbr class='fn' title='Sasha Volynets'>Sasha</abbr></a></cite>. <a href=''http://drawingroom.pbworks.com/Add-Your-Session">Speakers</a> for <span class='dtstart'><span class='value-title' title='2009-06-06'>tomorrow's</span> event (starting at <span class='value-title' title='14:00'>2pm</span>)</span> have proposed some really interesting sessions. It's going to be great fun.</p>

<p>Personally, I'll be standing up to blabber out everything I learned about <strong>Designing for Location</strong> when I worked on <a href='http://fireeagle.com'>Fire Eagle</a>, and hopefully get people thinking and inspired about just how fiddley the whole field can be. I'll also be co-leading a session on designing the perfect wiki; since Wednesday's organiser meeting ended with agreement that every single piece of wiki software on this earth sucks somehow.</p>

<p>It's being hosted by <span class='location vcard'><span class='adr'><a class='fn org' href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=585+Howard+Street,+First+Floor+San+Francisco+CA+94105'>Hot Studio</a> at <span class='street-address'>585 Howard Street</span> (<span class='extended-address'>First Floor</span>), <span class='locality'>San Francisco</span> <abbr class='region' title='California'>CA</abbr> <span class='postal-code'>94105</span></span></span>.</p>
