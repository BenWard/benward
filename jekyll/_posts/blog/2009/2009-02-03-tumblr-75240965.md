The login page is horribly cluttered with ads and other garbage, but the advice appears right by the log in box, so it's pretty good work for what it is. I find it interesting that they using ‘URL’ in their terminology rather than ‘address’ or a visual to make it clear. I don't know that the MySpace demographic could be assumed to know what the term ‘URL’ means.
