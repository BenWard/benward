> • Wave is an open network: anyone should be able to become a wave provider and interoperate with the public network
> • Wave is a distributed network model: traffic is routed peer-to-peer, not through a central server

Still quite a lot to consume concerning wave. Whether it's the email/IM/Facebook killer mega-protocol for the 21st century or not remains to be seen. 

But, these first two points from the <a href="http://www.waveprotocol.org/wave-community-principles">Community Principles‎</a> are important. At the very least, from these to intentions they are trying to build something new for the web, not just for them. And that makes it interesting.

A million questions remain, but I think that given the above intent, it should be approached with enthusiasm and not suspicion.
