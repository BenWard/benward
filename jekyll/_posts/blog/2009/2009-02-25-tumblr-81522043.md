  <li><span class="h-card">Ben</span>: <q>Give Seth a cuddle</q></li>
  <li><span class="h-card">Kevin Ryan</span>: <q>He is in SVN…</q></li>
  <li><span class="h-card">Ben</span>: <q>He&#39;s _in_ SVN? Like, trapped there? Like in Tron?</q></li>
  <li><span class="h-card">Kevin Ryan</span>: <q>… And trying to help me figure out what is up with my sever access, apparently my password keeps randomly changing</q></li>
  <li><span class="h-card">Ben</span>: <q>Hmm, Tron 2 is already in production, but Tron 3 as ‘An accident in version control’ would be AMAZING</q></li>
  <li><span class="h-card">Ben</span>: <q>The final showdown would have Seth and Jeff Bridges team up with previous revisions of themselves to defeat whoever it is that&#39;s changing your password…</q></li></ol>
