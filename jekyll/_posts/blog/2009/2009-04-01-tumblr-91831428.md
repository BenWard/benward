Some years ago, [Jo](http://joanslow.com) wanted to buy a bass guitar. I've forgotten the model she eventually bought, but I remember falling in love with a certain [Washburn Electro-Acoustic model](http://www.washburn.com/basses/acoustic-electric-series/#ab10). Yes, it was more for the design and that gorgeous slotted bout than what it might sound like, but since guitars in my house spend 97% of the time being decorative anyway, that's a major plus.

As I can barely play any of the guitars I already have any more, I probably shouldn't buy this now.
