New feature in iTunes 9. First, go to <kbd>File: Library: Organise Library</kbd> and then check the <kbd>Upgrade to iTunes Media organisation</kbd> check-box. This rearranges your iTunes Media folder to split TV, Movies and Music into separate top level directories, ending the years of semantic teeth gnashing that came of having ‘TV Shows’ and ‘Movies’ muddled in with you music artists.

So, that's worth doing in itself. However, the new folder structure comes with this other new folder, <samp>Automatically Add to iTunes</samp>. It's a folder with a pre-configured folder action, such that any media file you drop in there will be instantly added to iTunes.

In my case, my main iTunes install is on a Mac Mini by the television, where all media centre functions are. So, where this comes into its own is by sharing this magic folder over the network as a dropbox. So now, when I download music on my laptop or get sent it, I can just drag it onto the network share, and a few moments later, it will be available from the iTunes Remote application on my iPhone.

I'd been meaning to set this up myself ages ago (along with ‘Play now’, ‘Enqueue in iTunes DJ’ dropboxes too), but Apple seem to be catching up.
