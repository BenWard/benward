> What we’ve talked about is getting to a concept that we call livable communities, where people don’t have to get in a car every day. You can use light rail, you can use buses, you can use walking paths, you can use your bike.

<cite class='vcard'><a class='fn' href='http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/14/magazine/14FOB-q4-t.html'>Ray LaHood</a>, <abbr title='United States'>US</abbr> Secretary of Transportation.</cite>

One thing that has struck me very starkly about life in the <abbr>US</abbr> is just how completely ingrained the car-dependency is. Generations of car ownership has completely affected the way massive suburban conurbations are built, such that you can't just take them away. You can't just choose to live outside a city and not have a car; you won't be able to buy the food to eat. The <abbr>US</abbr> needs an entire infrastructural overhaul if were to function without cars. In that respect, whilst better light public transportation is highly desirable and will improve a lot of communities (reducing the quantity of cars on roads will improve general well-being and happiness for those affected), the only real solution to America as a pollutant is green cars.
