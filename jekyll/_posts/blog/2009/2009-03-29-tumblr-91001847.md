It's been years since I last tried to sketch anything. I should stress at this point that I've never really been very _good_ at sketching, or drawing, or most kinds of art.

Anyway.

For whatever reason we were sitting in Dolores Park yesterday, soaking up San Francisco's gorgeous March sunshine and looking over the Mission itself, I fancied a go.

This is why carrying a small Moleskin is important.
