Windows has a rough time with tabbed interfaces. Each change to the visual theme with each release of Windows changes them around. ThisÂ time, they're sporting some dreadfully weak gradient.

Unfortunately, and this is what makes it notable, Windows UI theme layer is shit. Whereas when Mac OSX removed Brushed metal, it was _gone_, just-like-that, in every other app as well. On Windows, the window styles and ever-changing UI conventions are often implemented directly in the apps, so you get situations like this, where a crazy clash of UI styles occurs with Vista-era tabs appearing in a standard XP dialogue. An utter mess.
