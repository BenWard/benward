> Inspired by <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2009/12/12/twitter-api/">Wordpress&#8217; seriously clever use of Loren Brichter&#8217;s new Tweetie options</a>, we&#8217;re launching our own Tweetie and Twitterrific compatible API. This Twitter-like API should make it easy for a lot of existing Twitter clients to start supporting Tumblr.
> The really cool thing - because our following models follow a lot of the same principles, we&#8217;ve been able to take advantage of a ton of native features:
>
> * Retweeting = Reblogging
> * Replying = Reblogging w/ commentary
> * Favoriting = Liking
> * &#8220;@david&#8221; = &#8221;http://david.tumblr.com/&#8221;
> * Conversations = Reblogs

I'm trying to write a script to "like" the posts on Tumblr that I save a in my feed reader (Fever) "saved items". I want my affection to be automatically mirrored on Tumblr.

The [bespoke Tumblr API](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/api) doesn't expose liking, _but_ the [new Twitter API clone](http://staff.tumblr.com/post/287703110/api) does (in cloning Twitter's [favorites API](http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method%3A-favorites%C2%A0create).) However, the cloned Tumblr-Twitter API exposes posts with entirely different identifiers than the regular API, making their methods non-interoperable. I didn't spot an obvious transformation between the two numbers, though the ‘Twumblr’ API IDs are all much larger.

Paging Tumblr staff, or other people smarter/better informed than me. Suggestions or solutions would be greatly appreciated.
