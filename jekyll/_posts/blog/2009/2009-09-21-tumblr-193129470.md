Guitar Toolkit is actually one of the very first apps I bought for my iPhone, way back when the App Store launched. It's always been a beautifully designed guitar tuner app, with built in chord reference library.

With terrifying convenience, the update released this week has added support for the Mandolin, an instrument that arrived mysteriously in the mail this week.

Everything about Guitar Toolkit's interaction makes it an incredible learner tool. As well as the traditional needle tuner, you can also pick strings on the screen to tune by ear, and strum the chord shapes when you're trying to contort your fingers around this tiny little fretboard. It's a great way to learn by imitation, learn by sound, and provides a definitive reference as you try to get it right.

The attention to detail is immense.
