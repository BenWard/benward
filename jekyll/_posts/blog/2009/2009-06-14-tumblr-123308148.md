[Linkinus](http://conceitedsoftware.com/products/linkinus) is a rather fine Mac OSX IRC client, which just hit version 2.0. The new release seems to be a bit buggy and prone to UI freezes, but the functionality is fantastic. Here's the improved embed UI, whereby any hyperlink in conversation (from a known source) gets converted into an inline embed for viewing on the fly. Nice, understated UI.

It's a good use case for implementing [oEmbed](http://oembed.com/), too.
