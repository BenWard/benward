No. It hasn't. It affects Jailbroken OS3 in some situations. No-one with an off-the-shelf iPhone running Apple's software is affected. This fact is not mentioned until the third paragraph. I really hate the BBC's technology coverage sometimes. This is just cheap, fuddy sensationalist linkbait and it's not OK.
