[So many a second](http://smas.studioludens.com/) is a lovely little visualisation for all those things that are just two big to comprehend. Five people born every two seconds? 47 plastic airline cups manufactured _every second_. These are the things that defy our comprehension of scale, but this visualisation makes it a little more real.

I recommend viewing in split screen, juxtaposing births against deaths and considering that each little icon falling down the screen is an actual person coming or going. The screengrab above is of plastic cups produced for airlines verses trees felled. ([via. Gizmodo](http://i.gizmodo.com/5155061/what-the-27-cellphones-produced-per-second-looks-like))
