> The trouble with a ‘scientific’ argument, of course, is that it is not made in the real world, but in a laboratory by an unimaginative academic relying solely on empirical facts.

The choice quote from A. N. Wilson's anti-science tour de farce on the Daily Mail site. It's called “[Yes, scientists do much good. But a country run by these arrogant gods of certainty would truly be hell on earth](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1224858/Yes-scientists-good-But-country-run-arrogant-gods-certainty-truly-hell-earth.html)”. No, really.

1300 words, two of which are ‘Hitler’ (also, two mentions of ‘Nazi’ and one of ‘Soviet Russia’.)
