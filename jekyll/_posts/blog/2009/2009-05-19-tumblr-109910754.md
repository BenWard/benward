It's been a while in the making, and I've been hooked on ‘Talking Backwards’ for a very long time since bought the 7", but [Fanfarlo](http://www.fanfarlo.com/)'s album is finally coming out.

No word on vinyl yet (which, should it become available I will buy in an instant; the aforementioned 7" sounds so good with the added warmth and hiss), but in the meantime Rough Trade have a super-special-edition for a remarkably reasonable £10.99.

(You can buy the special edition from <a href="https://www.roughtrade.com/site/shop_detail.lasso?search_type=sku&sku=312321">Rough Trade</a>, or the regular version [direct from the band](http://fanfarlo.com/reservoir).)
