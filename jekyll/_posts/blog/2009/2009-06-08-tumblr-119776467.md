Yesterday's [Chromatic](http://bit.ly/chromatic) event was fantastic fun. ‘Designing for Location’ went across pretty well, though I messed up my timing and thereby wrecked all hope of having a discussion (I'm sorry!). Anyway, people seemed very responsive to the subject matter. A couple of people asked me to come back next month and do more. I'm quite tempted.

I'm keen to do a full, proper (big) write up of this presentation over on [ben-ward.co.uk](http://ben-ward.co.uk), but in the interests of prompt response, I've pushed up my slides from yesterday's session, along with my pretty-much-raw presenters notes/brainstorming document.
