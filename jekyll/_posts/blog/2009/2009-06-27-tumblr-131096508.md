I saw Transformers 2 yesterday, so now I'm trawling the internet looking for ways to avenge my poor, mangled brain from Michael Bay's assault.

This is from last year. The plot for “Michael Bay's ‘The Dark Knight’” is both more substantial and makes much more sense than Transformers 2. It also accurate represents his depiction of women in the new film.
