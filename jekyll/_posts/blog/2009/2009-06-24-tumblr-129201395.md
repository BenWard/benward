> We are asking all citizens (that's you!) government agencies, local businesses and non-profits to do an assessment of their expenditures and see if they can shift an additional 10% of their annual budget to local independents.Â 

Making a deliberate effort to support local independent businesses to stimulate the economy. You'll get better produce, too.
