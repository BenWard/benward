> In the center of the main gallery is a Rirkrit designed ping pong table (produced by Cumulus Studios) fabricated to be played outdoors.  The piece is mirror polished aluminum that pulls in its surroundings to the surface of the table.  Its fetishistic surface should not mislead the player / spectator that the table doesnâ€™t deliver championship play.
