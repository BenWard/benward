> Leonardo’s surname was not Da Vinci. He was from Vinci, or of Vinci. As many critics have pointed out, calling it The Da Vinci Code is like saying Mr Of Arabia or asking What Would Of Nazareth Do?

I'm familiar with the fact that Dan Brown is an absolutely terrible writer, but this is ridiculous.

Admittedly, I didn't know the etymology of ‘Da Vinci’ until I read this, but then, I never wrote a book about it either.
