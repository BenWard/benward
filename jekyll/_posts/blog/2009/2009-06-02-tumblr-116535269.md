> The technology has been described as e-mail for the 21st Century, a rival to Twitter and to Microsoft's collaboration software, Sharepoint.

Wave has also obsoleted both the unicorn _and_ the rainbow. A feat not accomplished since their respective extinction and invention around the time of biblical ark.

Honestly. “Rival to Twitter”. If Wave has any relevance to microblogging then I've got a rival to Twitter right here in my pants… You wanna write about that, BBC?

Wave looks great in its own right. Tech stories that don't mention Twitter are still allowed.
