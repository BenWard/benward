Since [Marco](http://marcovhv.tumblr.com/) and I are exchanging thoughts on the world of MySpace profile design, thought I'd dig up the origin of the MySpace Profile design ‘challenge’ that was popular in web dev a few years ago. That for me started when Mike Davidson turned his Profile (one-point-oh) into something beautiful.

I still fancy the idea of doing this. Except that I upgraded to Profile 2.0, so… yeah.

That he was later able to [prank John McCain](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2007/03/hacking-a-more-tasteful-john-mccain) with it adds tasty sprinkles to the whole concept.
