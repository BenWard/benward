> A city where pizza is only consumed as a booze sponge.

Question to all: What is it with San Francisco's reputation concerning pizza?

Is it because I only ever eat from Little Star and Delfina that I'm ignorant to some twisted, dark underbelly of San Francisco, where terrible cheese-lathered bread-product unworthy of the name ‘pizza’ is rubbed against a dog and baked in the warmth of someone's flatulence? Is there really pizza that bad in this city? Is New York really _that good_? Am I going to have to fly across the country to find out? Who wants to come? _When_?
