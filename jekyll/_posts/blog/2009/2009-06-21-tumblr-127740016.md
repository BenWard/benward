For the past month I've had a handful of screengrabs on my desk, all taken from Photoshop. They're all in the [Adobe Gripe](http://adobegripes.tumblr.com) vein, and I've been meaning to post them for a while. At the same time, I didn't want to over-do my Adobe bitching too intensely, because I know I'm not so pretty when I bitch.

Unfortunately, I've never gotten around to sneaking these in amongst meatier content, so instead, for your snarky viewing pleasure, I'm just going to blast them out one after another, be done with it, and delete them from my desktop. Come, be cleansed with me.

In this first episode, Adobe's insistence on using a shit cross-platform UI layer rather native controls (or, alternatively, a _good_ cross-platform UI layer), results in entirely stupid slider artefacts.
