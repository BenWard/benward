> There is a new sidebar pane when you inspect an element in the Elements Tree Hierarchy. If the current Node has registered event listeners there is a separate section for each type of event registered (click, mouseover, etc). Within each of these lists is a display of all of the event listeners in the entire event flow for that type. That means you see all the Capturing Event Listeners followed by the Bubbling Event Listeners in the exact order that they execute and on which nodes they are registered.
