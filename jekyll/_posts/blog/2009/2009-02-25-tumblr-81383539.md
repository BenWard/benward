Incredibly likeable Channel 4 newsreader <cite><a href='https://twitter.com/krishgm'>Krishnan Guru-Murthy</a></cite> comments on Twitter as a news source, following this morning's [Amsterdam plane crash](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7909683.stm). A Twitter user named [@nipp](https://twitter.com/nipp) provided a live eye-witness account of the crash on [Twitter](http://twitter.com), which was picked up by the C4 news team, who are avid Twitter users. ‘Nipp’ ended up interviewed on their television news very shortly after, initial contact being made through Twitter.

It's a great feat of modern communication, and you would expect it to be followed by over-the-top OMGTWITTER hyperventilation on the part of media types and Twitter users alike. Instead, it is refreshing to read Krishnan's perfectly balanced take on it all:

> its just another way of finding people and talking. twitizen journalism is a rather dressy way of describing it i think
>
> so yes good - but not particularly new or unique, just a new medium
