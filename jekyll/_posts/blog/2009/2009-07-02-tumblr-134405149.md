*[Graded Browser Support Update: Q3 2009](http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2009/07/02/gbs-update-20090702/)*

Summer refresh of the Graded Browser Support testing matrix. Now including Firefox 3.5 and Safari 4, and reducing the test coverage of Opera (although note that Opera should still receive an ‘A’ grade experience, we're just only testing it on Windows.)
