I had so forgotten all about this one. Running Windows last week for some browser testing brought back a gem of a redraw error, where dragging a window over the top of another, stalled window will produce this beautiful streaking. It used to happen so often you'd become desensitised, and the error would just pass you by.

A few years in Mac OSX wonderland and I'm jolted back to seeing just how appalling the Windows experience can be.
