The Mac OSX character palette is magnificent in many ways. Browsing for unicode, searching for characters by name, previews of character rendering in different typefaces. It's _thorough_. My favourite feature is the ability to add individual glyphs to a favourites tab, though, so I get quick access to â™¥ all day long.
