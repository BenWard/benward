> Of course, patriots know that the 50-star flag truly represents one nation under God and our Founders' republic, but modernists simply don't get it. So what do you say we make a statement by flying a different flag and educate our neighbors when they ask us, "Why are you flying that flag instead of the contemporary Stars and Stripes?" (If you insist on posting a modern USA flag, too, then **get one that is tea-stained to show your solidarity with our Founders**.)

Yes! Show your olde-timey patriotism for the USA by desecrating your flag! With the favoured drink of… British people.

I say ‘old timey’, but I guess I mean [1954](http://undergod.procon.org/viewanswers.asp?questionID=001330), since that's the actual origin of the ‘under God’ stuff, not the founding fathers. But of course, the teabagging/Becker movement is all about spreading [Mormon revisionist history](http://blog.benward.me/post/189653456).
