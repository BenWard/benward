*[Ben Ward's Eyes](http://flickr.com/photos/benwardseyes)*

I've taken to microblogging like a duck to water, and there's a great appeal in doing the same with photographs. I take random pictures of things throughout my day, and to stream them out rather than just archive them is appealing.

I don't want this on my regular Flickr account, though; it would flood it with poor quality pictures. The interest in a real photostream like this is as a complete page, not necessarily the individual photographs.

So, stumped a little for how to host this, I've started a second Flickr account. ‘Ben Ward's Eyes’ it's called. What I'll do next is create a proper front-end for it, but for now the regular small-photo grid will have to do.
