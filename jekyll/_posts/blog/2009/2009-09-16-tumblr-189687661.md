The previous post is a first step in trying to identify myself. I've stared at my unstyled blog pages for a long time now and not really being an artist, I got nothinâ€™. If I were to approach someone to design my blog for me, or even just some art for the header, I haven't the faintest clue what I'd ask for, not even a direction, style or starting point.

The four words try to describe me in the context of what I create, how I communicate and how I write. Oddly, they came out of imagining something artistic and visual.

I have no idea where this will end up, but I'm all ears for other forms of interesting self-discovery. I'm trying to end up somewhere that I can make something visual that represents me and what I do.
