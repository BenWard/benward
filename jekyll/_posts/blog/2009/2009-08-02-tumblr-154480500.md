*[Will my site be archived? - Yahoo! GeoCities Help](http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/geocities/close/close-17.html)*

After [great work by Jason Scott](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2045) and a decent amount in internal, CEO-level haranguing at Yahoo (by, I can only assume, various different parties acting independently), archiving the content of Geocities is not being somewhat supported by Y.

It's nothing like as much as I'd hoped for (I asked for us to handover the data, URL mappings and a box of old servers to Archive.org; optimistic), but it's good. The Yahoo help pages are now instructing people of how to ensure their site is archived, and (critically) it's happening anyway.

So, we [suck less than AOL](http://www.peopleconnectionblog.com/2008/11/06/hometown-has-been-shutdown). It's a start. (A shame that AOL have censored the user comments that humanised the upset of and real effect of that data loss; I can't find them in archive.org, either.)
