> What you may ask, is the dilemma, since it is clear that any decent human being would simply refuse to have anything to do with something so lurid?

 <cite><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/07/15/arrington-twitter">Daring Fireball Linked List: Do Unto Others</a></cite>

What will it take for _you_ to man up and shun TechCrunch? It's nothing but a filthy, gossip ridden ego-vehicle for Michael Arrington. TechCrunch has proved itself harmful to individuals, companies and our industry.

This is not complicated: _Stop interacting with TechCrunch_. Just stop. Shun them. Ignore them.

Do not subscribe to their feed. Do not read their posts. Do not comment on their articles. Do not pimp your company to them. Do not grant them interviews. Do not send them pre-release detail of your product. Do not write guest articles for their blog.

Cut them out. Avoid poisonous people and contribute to decent efforts instead.

TechCrunch thrives only on negativity. Negativity that our industry should have rejected a very long time ago. I don't really understand why it is tolerated at all.

Seriously consider this: What do you do that makes TechCrunch relevant? Can you stop it, please?
