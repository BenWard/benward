> Respondent's domain name, [glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990.com](http://glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990.com) is **confusingly similar** to Complaiant's “Glenn Beck” trademark as it incorporates the “Glenn Beck” name and mark entirely.

Emphasis mine. Assuming they are human, and not in fact actual demon spawn, it is my assumption that Glenn Beck's lawyer's will have stopped midway through writing their legal takedown of [glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990.com](http://glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990.com) to piss themselves laughing at the sheer absurdity of the claims they are making.

You can read a [full copy of the legal complaint](http://deathblow.org/legal/Complaint.pdf), if you like.
