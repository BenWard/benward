<a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/2009/09/arial-versus-helvetica.html">swissmiss  | Arial versus Helvetica</a>

I've always maintained an undoubtedly conditioned preference for Helvetica, but objected to Arial out of principal and the shady terms of its commission and creation rather than anything major about the letterforms. (Although the chop on the ‘t’ ascender is horrific.) Now, seeing the details side-by-side with Helvetica like this has me well into the ‘Arial sucks’ camp for perfectly well informed reasons. I mean, the finial on Arial's ‘a’ is pretty inferior, but the upper-case _R_, oh my goodness. Eugh.
