If you thought Safari 4 was shitting with us for munging the tab control into the title bar, Microsoft are clearly not sitting around with their own UI clusterfuck project.

Holy shit, the Outlook 2010 toolbar looks dreadful. Was the ribbon really just an excuse to stop teaching people how to align buttons? Duplicated labels? The continued insistence on indicating when a message is ‘HTML’ or ‘Plain Text’ in the document title? (Hint: the format is not relevant to the end user…) The huge, glossy Windows Media Player control?

There's no grace, no joy and no class in Windows.
