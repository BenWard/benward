[Marco](http://marcovhv.tumblr.com) posted about some of the [quirkier unicode glyphs](http://marcovhv.tumblr.com/post/83898730/wicked-cool-unicode-characters), and notes:

> The characters differ from browser to browser in terms of appearance. I have no idea why this is. Fascinating!

The characters vary because Firefox and Safari use different font rendering engines â€” Firefox of course being non-native to Mac OSX.

Most unicode glyphs don't exist in every font, so an intelligent text rendering system, such as that in OSX, will swap a missing glyph with one from another font, rather than displaying [mojibake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake).

Because Firefox and Safari have different text layers, they pick different typefaces.
