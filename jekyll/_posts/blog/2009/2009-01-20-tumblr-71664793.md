> This pattern can be used to resolve some long standing issues with including machine-data in microformats; it's imperative we test thoroughly before adding it to any pattern specification. Following are a number of example tests. Please try them out.

Here we go then. The culmination of most of my recent microformats efforts. If this works as well as I think it does, we give publishers the flexibility they've been asking for that the existing <code>abbr</code>-based patterns don't provide. It gives control over inclusion of dates, time duration and US-English keywords.

If it doesn't work as I hope, then we're going to learn a bit of relevant information about screen reader handling. Here's hoping for the former, though.
