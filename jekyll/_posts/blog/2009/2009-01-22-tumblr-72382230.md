On the iPhone, Google Maps allows you to use ‘Current Location’ as a start or end point when generating driving directions. This feature is missing from the desktop edition, because there's no widely supported interface between the web browser and the user's location information.

Except that there is. And it's name is [Fire Eagle](http://fireeagle.com). Maps-Fire Eagle integration would have made my life easier this morning.
