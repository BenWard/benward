I'm _fairly sure_ that when Adobe original revealed the periodic table of Creative Suite icons they got lambasted and mocked for being, well, a bit shit.

I don't really know that I have an opinion on them any more, but I do find it interesting that a few years on, someone has been able to turn them into a product that people will presumably buy. That enough users must have become enthusiastic for the designs, and enough other users apathetic toward the designs not to object, is quite a turnaround.
