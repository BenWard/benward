Opera has the most interesting response to this ridiculous error, it has a button to ‘reparse as HTML’. Unfortunately pressing the button didn't actually work. Points for the idea though.

How did I send off my taxes? I had to launch Internet Explorer in a Virtual Machine. Seriously.

Though, in retrospect, maybe I could have done it with IE5:Mac.
