The construct of your gags this week is:

* The Terrorists are trying to take our freedom!
* But, they failed.
* So now we can't take iPods on planes.
* Pause.
* Witty remark of shallow political comentary.

This joke will still work even when it turns out that we can take iPods on planes, because no-one will be paying attention.

End on witty remark of shallow cultural comentary.
