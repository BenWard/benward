I want one these. For real, in my hands.

Thunderbird 2 folder icon. (via <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cocoia">Icon Designer</a>, via [Sebastiaan de With](https://twitter.com/Cocoia/status/1276366544), via. [Craig Hockenberry](https://twitter.com/chockenberry/status/1276418923))

Actually, the thought occurs, Thunderbird two would in fact make for an incredible laptop shell. Think about that ‘2’ with the strip on the backside of the screen. I want _that_.

… even though Thunderbird 4 was my favourite.
