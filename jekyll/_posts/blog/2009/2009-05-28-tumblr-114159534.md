You may be aware that this weekend TechCrunch [reposted their bullshit](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/22/deny-this-lastfm/) ‘<abbr title="Oh My God">OMG</abbr> Last.FM are sharing data with the RIAA’ story. Last time around I lost my mind and spent about three days blogging all sorts of anger about TechCrunch and how much of a vindictive, manipulative, trolling, industry harming flangehorse Michael Arrington is. Then Last.FM officially responded with [TechCrunch are full of shit](http://blog.last.fm/2009/02/23/techcrunch-are-full-of-shit) and won the internet.

This time around Last.FM staff like Russ spent the weekend engaged with users on their forums, issuing [new denials](http://www.last.fm/forum/21717/_/535934/8#f9525592) and having really interesting dialogue about it all. TechCrunch spent the weekend [baiting](http://twitter.com/arrington/status/1888429185), [deleting legitimate criticism](http://twitter.com/alexmuller/status/1903186356) from their blog comments and getting [inexplicably aggressive](http://twitter.com/arrington/status/1897562957) on Twitter. Go figure.

There are couple of separate issues that I wanted to raise about it in a future post, but meantime, CBS issued a short, swift denial (which surely won't satisfy Arrington), finishing with this quite succinct dig at his now even more shambolic reputation. CBS, being a big faceless corporation, communicate in dull terms. But as far as cold corporate vernacular goes, I raise a glass and a smile to this cold, corporate reimagining of ‘TechCrunch are full of shit’.
