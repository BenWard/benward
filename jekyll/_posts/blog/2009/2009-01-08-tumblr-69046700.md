iTunes, having gone DRM-free yesterday, is now being a bitch. I want to upgrade my DRM-infected tracks to the new ones, but iTunes doesn't seem to think I own any. The reason, I'm prepared to bet money on, is my account shifting between the UK and US.

This caused grief trying to reactivate my iPhone over Christmas — I had to move back to UK billing details, and then back to US details after activation. I reckon that when you move country in iTunes, it loses your purchase history. So, it doesn't offer up the songs I bought from the UK iTunes store for upgrade, nor does it offer the song I bought in the US before I toggled it over to activate my iPhone.

Of course, the reason for moving the account rather than having two (benward-uk and benward-us) is firstly to keep the DRM purchases (and thus activation of those purchases) linked to the same account, and secondly because _having two accounts for the same service is completely retarded_.

Yet again, it seems that iTunes test cases are coming up short.
