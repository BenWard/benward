> The other day we ran a story from Valleywag with a rumor that Steve Jobs was undergoing surgery. After talking to someone I trust more than I trust Owen Thomas's source (who I admit I don't know very much about) my take is that he wasn't "under the knife" on Monday as rumored, but was at Apple in meetings. I'm don't find this very satisfying to write about, but I'm sharing this data to nullify the likely wrong data from the valleywag post that appeared on Gizmodo. That is all.

Or, _“When sharing a blog network with Valleywag goes bad”_. Valleywag seems to have been cross-linked quite a bit on Gizmodo lately, so I can only assume it's an active Gawker Media effort to promote the content after the reorg. Can't see it lasting when it hurts Gizmodo's reputation like this.
