<ol class="conversation">
  <li><span class="h-card">Ben</span>: <q>Hey Ben, did you do the laundry like I asked?</q></li>
  <li><span class="h-card">Ben</span>: <q>Oh, hey Ben, you look nice. No, I just emptied all the dirty laundry into the middle of the bedroom floor; juggled it around a bit; played football with the socks. Figured you&#39;d sort it out.</q></li>
  <li><span class="h-card">Ben</span>: <q>No, you shit, I&#39;ve spent all evening doing our taxes, and resurrecting our Green Card application so we don&#39;t almost get deported again. Remember that?</q></li>
  <li><span class="h-card">Ben</span>: <q>I remember your mum.</q></li>
  <li><span class="h-card">Ben</span>: <q>Well, yes, good work sending those flowers. But even so, what the fuck? We have no socks and the bath towel smells kinda flunky again.</q></li>
  <li><span class="h-card">Ben</span>: <q>You had better put the washing on then.</q></li>
  <li><span class="h-card">Ben</span>: <q>Do we have any quarters?</q></li>
  <li><span class="h-card">Ben</span>: <q>Nope. Hey, is that rain out? At least Ariel made you buy an umbrella, right?</q></li>
  <li><span class="h-card">Ben</span>: <q>I hate you. I miss David. He bought better records than you, too.</q></li></ol>
