> Just like on its desktop counterpart, the Mail app in the iPhone 3.0 update can now reply with only a quote from the original e-mail. To achieve that, you […] select the portion of text you want to quote. Then just hit the reply button and the selected fragment will be appended at the end of the email.

Yes! Proper reply quoting in iPhone Mail (one of my favourite subtle features of Mail.app on OSX).

Which is to say, it's now morally acceptable to slap top-posting email users in the face again. (Download the ‘Wet Fish’ application for this.)
