The most notable thing I remember from art classes in school was building a model clay house when I was 15. Most people built nice houses, with smiles and flowers, and fences and a shrubbery. However, due to a mid-teens Tarantino infatuation, all the people in my house were gangsters, and half of them were dangling from windows, somewhat dismembered or missingâ€¦ internal organs. They _all_ had hats.

The odd thing is that I genuinely didn't think anything of it at the time. I didn't even understand the perplexed look my mother gave me when I brought it home months later. In retrospect maybe it was a little disturbing for the quiet, surly boy in the corner, with few friends and self-confidence issues to be clay modelling scenes of intense graphic violence.

Oh, teenage Ben. What an enigma.
