> Only 36% of people view the GOP favorably, with an outright majority of 54% viewing them unfavorably.

I can only assume that someone in the GOP Fortress of Evil, this conversation went down last November:

“Fucking hell, that was pretty rough. Oh well, it's been a while since we weren't in power, so how shall we approach this new period of opposition politics?”
“Ooh, ooh I know! Let's act like absolute fucking despicable cocks at every opportune moment. And, wherever possible, also in the inopportune moments. People will definitely identify with that that.”
“Sounds brilliant. Get me Sarah Palin's number.”

Oddly, given the above 100% real transcript, the GOP candidate for New York's 23rd district actually dropped out because she wasn't enough of a despicable cock. That left a hard-right Conservative party candidate Doug Hoffman who had—I shit you not—_actually signed_ [Glenn Beck's 9-12 pledge](http://www.the912project.com/2009/09/11/glenns-pledge-for-our-elected-officials/). He proceeded to [lose NY-23](http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/11/ny-23-owens-wins.php?ref=fpa) to a Democrat for the first time since _1854_.

Good work, GOP. You are examples to us all.
