# [Here and There](http://schulzeandwebb.com/hat/)

> Because the ability to be in a city and to see through it is a superpower, and it's how maps should work.

<cite>Jack Schulze</cite>

[Schulze and Webb](http://schulzeandwebb.com) have produced ‘[Here and There](http://schulzeandwebb.com/hat/)’, incredible bendy maps of Manhattan. I've never been to Manhattan, but these maps are beautiful and provide an incredible insight to the city. Imagine if every subway station had maps like these?

You can also [buy large prints for your wall](http://schulzeandwebb.com/hat/#prints), if you like.
