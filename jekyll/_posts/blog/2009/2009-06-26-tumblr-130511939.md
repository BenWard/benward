> We're pleased to announce a formal partnership with  Yahoo! to support the NVDA project. Their first funding contribution will enable us to implement enhanced table navigation and reporting in virtual buffers, ARIA land marks, ARIA drag and drop and other ARIA improvements in NVDA over the next couple of months

I tend not to post much employer related stuff here, but reading that Yahoo! have popped some funds into the excellent NVDA accessibility tool is really warming news. Nice to see us assist with Good Things™

> Providing feedback via synthetic speech and Braille, NVDA allows blind and vision impaired people to access and interact with the Windows operating system and many third party applications.
