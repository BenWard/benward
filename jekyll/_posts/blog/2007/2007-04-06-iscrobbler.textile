For my <a href="http://last.fm">Last.FM</a> update and syncing needs I've long been a user of <a href="http://www.last.fm/group/iScrobbler">iScrobbler</a> — rather than the official client. It's minimal, tidy and provides funcational-enough iPod updating too.

There's a new beta of 1.5 just come out and it's got a really neat new integration of the ‘Love’ and ‘Ban’ buttons normally associated only with Last.FM radio.

Seeing as I play my own music far more than Last.FM's this is a mightily neat addition since the Love feature was going unused. You can also send the current track as a recommendation to someone on your friend's list or add tags which is also quite handy.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Ooh, that’s pretty shiny. I’ve been using this version of iScrobbler for a while already, but due to nigh-on all my music listening being from the iPod I hadn’t actually noticed that it has this feature.</p></div>
