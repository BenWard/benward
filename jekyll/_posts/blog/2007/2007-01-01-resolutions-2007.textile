It's the new year. And there are things in my life that are really quite different to new years of the past. This is a new year that I feel genuinely happy and positive about, rather than indifferent and agnostic which is how I normally greet the increment of <code>YYYY</code>.

This year I have two resolutions.

<strong>Every day I will read from a book. Even if just a little</strong>, I will endeavour to make reading a regular part of my days. 

For far too many years I haven't really read many books at all. Next to me as I write this are three that I started and didn't finish. When I read I enjoy it, but for some reason I just <em>don't</em> when left to my own devices. This year I want that to change. Without books I'm feeling unfulfilled. I'm feeling left out of something that makes other people — notably <a href="http://hanniross.com" rel="friend met sweetheart muse">Hanni</a> — very happy indeed.

<strong>Every morning I will do sit-ups</strong>. Now, there are certain individuals in the world who — if they read this at all — will — if they were drinking at the time — possibly have spat all over their computer with laughter at reading this. It's true; I vow to regularly do sit-ups rather often (four or five times last year, at least). I manage it once, twice — perhaps for a week — and then stop. Maybe I'll fail again but at least it'll do me some post-Christmas good. Also, this time I've ordered myself a fitness mat on which to do them.

Happy new year.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything in there that I don&#8217;t identify with on one level or another! I too want to read more often and get rid of some of the excess blubber burrently residing about my person.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that, give a week or two, I&#8217;ll still be reading most days and the sit-ups will be long-forgotten, but then 1 out of 2 aint bad!</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m the other way round &#8211; I&#8217;ll read fairly often (normally a little bit at least a few times a week) but I end up with a couple of books on the go at the same time :D</p>
<p>At the moment I&#8217;m reading Science of Discworld 2, before which I read Science of Discworld 3 (we got hold of it first for some reason :D). It&#8217;s not quite a normal book but during Science of Discworld 2 I&#8217;ve read the QI book of General Ignorance. Even better, I started Science of Discworld 3 (and possibly even Pratchett&#8217;s Wintersmith before that) while I&#8217;m half way through the &#8220;House Harkonnen&#8221; Dune book. I will get round to reading it to the end at some point (maybe after Science of Discworld 2 and Why Penguin&#8217;s Feet Don&#8217;t Freeze) but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not right to have so many books on the go at once!</p>
<p>Good luck with the resolutions ;) I never bother making any because I know they just won&#8217;t stay.</p></div>
