I'm very late. SXSW was fantastic, that's all needs saying at this point.

I've been busy finding a new job and paying the bills so blogging hasn't been top of my list. However, I wanted to draw more attention to this photo I took at the Virb/Purevolume party.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/benward/420429069/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/166/420429069_eab1d06e35.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></a>

It's Dave Singleton celebrating his Wii Tennis victory over Upcoming.org's Andy Baio in a way that I think only Dave would with a guy he'd only just met. It's Creative Commons licensed, so feel free to download it and draw on speech bubbles and so on.
