Dave and I spent the entire evening playing Pro Evo 6 on the XBox. It was awesome. Especially winning 7–2. I digress though, as more awesome was our soundtrack. I would like to highly recommend that you listen to all of the following:

<ol>
  <li>‘Most of the Remixes…’, the new album from Soulwax. Which features an astonishingly good full length mix on the second disc. Especially, it sends DJ Shadow's ‘6 Days’ into uncharted, danceable rock out territory. (Thanks to Tom Coates for the recommendation).</li>
  <li>‘Still Alive’ by Jonathon Coulton, which is better known as ‘that song form the end or Portal’.</li>
  <li>The ‘Night Ripper’ set by Girl Talk</li>
  <li>‘A Night at the Hip-Hopera’ by The Kleptones</li>
  <li>‘Pickled Eggs and Sherbert’ by All Seeing I</li>
  <li>‘Sound of Silver’ by LCD Soundsystem</li>
</ol>

The reason for documenting it with quite so much enthusiasm is that all these records played together fantastically. Good for an upbeat Friday in.
