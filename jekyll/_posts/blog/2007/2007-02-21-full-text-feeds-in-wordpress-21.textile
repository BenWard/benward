Wordpress have inexplicably broken full-text feeds in Wordpress 2.1 but truncating any articles which contain a <code><!-- more --></code> separator â€” used to reduce the length of articles on the front page.

If you've upgraded to 2.1 and not noticed yet (I mean, it's not like we read our own feeds, is it?) the good news is that <a href="http://cavemonkey50.com/">Ronald Heft</a> has created <a href="http://cavemonkey50.com/code/full-feed">a plug-in</a> to restore the previous full text feed functionality. Yay.
