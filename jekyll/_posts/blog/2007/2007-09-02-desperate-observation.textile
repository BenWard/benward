A mid-thirties woman, with a skirt too short and cigarette hanging weakly from her lips, is wedging a closing train carriage door open with a high-healed foot. She's struggling as the doors push to close. All so that her knife-scarred boyfriend can force two pinches of tobacco into her purse.

Maybe it was just the dimming evening or the cold, but there was something desperately sad about that.
