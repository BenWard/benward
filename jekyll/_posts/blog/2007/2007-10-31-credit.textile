This week I've been trying to resolve my long-going mobile phone issues by finally signing up to Vodafone and cancelling my T-Mobile contract. As well as an inclusive allowance that will let me ring Hanni it means I can escape the terrible N95 handset I currently endure.

It's all hit a snag.

Apparently, for no reason that I can comprehend, I'm currently failing credit checks. Since moving to the flat in London I've passed at least one — getting the original T-Mobile contract, for instance. My bills get paid on time, my salary is healthy, <em>I'm already paying to same bloody amount on T-Mobile</em>… I don't get it. And of course, there's no reason given. I have to contact another company to get information about my credit score; this mystery number that can apparently determine what I do with my life.

I'm really rather upset about it all. There are immediate issues: The fact is I need to send back the T-Mobile phone ASAP or lose the ability to break out of that contract altogether. If I can't move to another contract, I'm going to lose my phone number. I've had it a few years and had been rather set of keeping it for as long as possible.

Then there's the more anxiety inducing issue of having my life obstructed — for no reasonable reason, I should stress — by an invisible factor. Whilst addled by anger and frustration as I try to sort out what in holy hell is going on, the realisation remains that I'm not completely in control of what I can do with my life.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend ran into a problem getting a mortgage a while back. She&#8217;d never had any debts, credit cards or mobile contracts, and as a result she should have had a clean bill of credit health. But no, she didn&#8217;t have a credit rating at all. Having a perfect credit history actually disadvantaged her.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the whole thing where shopping around for loans (etc) can damage your rating. Each time they run a credit check and you don&#8217;t take up the loan, it counts as a fail. Get a few of those and your rating is shafted.</p>
<p>It strikes me that the system might be a little bit broken.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi Ben</p>
<p>You state that you have recently moved in to your new property. Lenders will not lend to you unless they can confirm you at your current address, and they do this by looking at the electoral roll information for your address.</p>
<p>The annual register isn&#8217;t published until December, therefore it is likely that you do not appear on the electoral roll at your new address as yet.</p>
<p>You need to get a copy of your credit report to make sure all everything recorded in your name is all in order. Mistakes are often made as I have experienced whilst working in the financial sector for many years.</p>
<p>When you have received your report, you should be able to spot why you have been declined, if you can&#8217;t, T-Mobile should be able to give you a more specific reason why they have declined you.</p>
<p>Lenders can pick and choose who they want to lend to, so you just simply might not fit that lender&#8217;s specific lendng criteria.</p>
<p>My website www.howcreditworks.co.uk is currently being developed, which will offer much more helpful advice regarding credit issues once up and running.</p>
<p>Regards<br />
Jade</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>I have never had any form of credit and I’ve applied for a loan but have been declined.  The loan company transferred my details to another lender,  provident, they interest rates are unbelievable and I cannot understand why I’m being judged as if I had outstanding debts.  I understand that you need credit to get credit but is there any bank that would give me a loan. </p></div>
