Much has happened and I've not blogged about any of it. Meanwhile old entries are being spammed by soulless bots and lowlifes. The design isn't done. All in all, my blogging existence is a little unhealthy. I'll try to rectify all of these things one day. But for now, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/florenceandthemachinemusic">Florence and the Machine</a> has her first single out. She was my favourite act at South by South West this year, so enjoy.
