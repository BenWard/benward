*[Song of the Day](http://www.kleptones.com/blog/2007/01/22/hectic-city-6-leaving-here/)*

‘Leaving Here’, Eric Kleptone's Hectic City podcast #6.

This has been out for a while, but it's a mix crammed full of glorious 60's pop. I ♥ The Kleptones at the best of times, and whislt this isn't a set of their usual mash-ups, it's eclectic and summery and never ceases to make me smile.

In his words:

> Here’s a solid hour of fresh, exciting old shit :) - A good dig
> through the realms of 60s garage punk, proto rock and pumping
> mod. Most of the tracks date from round 1964-66, with a couple of 
> later ones, and they’re mostly from the UK”
