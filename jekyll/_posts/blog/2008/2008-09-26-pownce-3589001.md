In response to [Jeremy Keith on Pownce](http://pownce.com/adactio/notes/3589001/):

You're mostly correct, although I think you put the emphasis of this argument in the wrong place.

Even if Twitter used OAuth, a service you link would still be able to nefariously post spam to your account. The vital difference, and the part that should be emphasised, is not that they're prevented from doing it, it's that you're able to revoke their ability to do it, without changing your password, and without having to update your other third party applications.
