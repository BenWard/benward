At BlogTalk back in March and again at BarCamp London 4 last week I did a session on the foundations of Distributed Social Networking; a simple guide through the basics of describing ourselves and social relationships with XFN and hCard and how they can be pulled together to do some first-step but useful things.

I'm not totally sure the slides are useful by themselves, but I've had a few requests so I've published them, with the limited speaker notes I've been working from. I'm releasing them to you under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/uk/">Attribution–Non-Commercial–Share Alike UK</a> license. <small>Note that I am totally willing for the deck being reused commercially (if you wish to re-use them for a paid engagement, or wish to republish or modify a slide into a graphic for publication), but I do insist that you seek my explicit permission first, beyond the scope of the <abbr title="Creative Commons">CC</abbr> license; I simply wish to reserve the right to decline.</small>
