In the end, I decided to move my Pownce notes over to Tumblr by hand. They have an API and all, but given that I don't have much content here, it was a good opportunity to copy things over in a format that made sense, adjusting into Tumblr's video/audio/quote systems where available. 

Tumblr lets you modify the ends of permalinks, so I've plumped for a pattern of <code>pownce-123445</code> for each Pownce note, and <code>pownce-1234563-reply-5</code> for replies. 

I've also been adding tags of ‘geo:San Francisco’ to each note to replicate the Fire Eagle location. Not ideal, but at least the data isn't lost. 

Was nice reading through all the old posts. It's a huge shame that the conversations that came out of them will be lost to individual archives.
