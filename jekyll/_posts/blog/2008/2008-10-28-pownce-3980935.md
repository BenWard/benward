Cruz is WebKit based browser for OSX by the guy who made Fluid, with a proper Plugin API. UserScript, UserStyles and Cocoa plugins make this super-interesting.

Have a watch of the BrowsaBrowsa screencast on the Cruz site. Shows how he uses iPhone renderings of sites to create well fitted sidebars.

Fluid is also fabulous.
