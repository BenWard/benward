I want this shirt. I want this shirt perhaps more than any other. It's a shirt from Super Furry Animals ‘Phantom Power’ tour, for the song ‘Hello Sunshine’. The lyrics were as follows:

“I'm a minger, you're a minger too, so come on minger I want to ming with you.”

It's a high point in the history of music, poetry and romance. One of my life regrets is not buying the damned t-shirt.

It seems to be outrageously rare. SFA don't sell it any more, and I could find only one photograph of it on Flickr, and it turns out searching ‘minger’ on the internet is not very well aligned with finding band t-shirts. For some reason.
