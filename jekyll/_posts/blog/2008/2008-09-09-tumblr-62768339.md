One especially aggrevating passage in Sarah Palin's RNC speech last week was this:

‘Al-Qaeda terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America… he's [Obama] worried that someone won't read them their rights?’

So. Various constituional ammendments in the Bill of Rights support the presumption of innocence. It's a vital cornerstone of a just and free society.

It's terrifying that Sarah Palin supports pushing aside such an important principal; one of many laws that makes America a respectable nation.
It's more terrifying that she regards her opponent's defence of this constitutional principal something to be attacked on an election stage.
It's perhaps most terrifying that her remark quoted above was greeted by raptuous applause.
