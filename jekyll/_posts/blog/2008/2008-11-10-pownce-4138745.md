*[The Inspiration of Ownership](http://mikewest.org/2008/11/the-inspiration-of-ownership)*

Yahoo! Europe web developer Mike West has a short, sweet and inspiring essay on how the involvement of developments in a project motivates a quality product far more a paycheque; a lesson bigger organisations have to learn.

Nice comparisons with the Obama campaign.
