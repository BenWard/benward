Song of the Day: Beck - ‘Cellphone's Dead’

Filed under underlistened goes Beck's ‘The Information’ record, which is really rather sublime. Loads of worthwhile tracks to pick out: ‘Elevator Music’, ‘I think I'm love’, ‘Soldier Jane’… An excellent afternoon record.

— In supplement, the title track — ‘The Information’ — is also excellent: http://www.last.fm/music/Beck/The+Information/The+Information
