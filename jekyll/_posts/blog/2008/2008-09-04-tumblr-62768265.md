I've lived in my new apartment for 7 days so far. I just put in an order for a dining table and six chairs to go with it. Not sure they're going to match quite right, but the table shape is worth it and could always be stained later.

More importantly, this means that all the major pieces of furniture required for this place are covered. A sofa will arrive in about a month, a bed frame some time before that, dining table and chairs should come this week and television stand is already in place.

I've got a bean bag on order, which should tide me over until the real sofa comes.

With the basics covered, I'm feeling good that the essentials are done, and I can start focusing on less vital accessories.
