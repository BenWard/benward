Hey San Francisco! 

All my belongings arrived from the UK, so I'm having a quiet unboxing party at My Flat this evening. 

Come by, eat some pizza, drink some beer, play Xbox, write your book, socialize, nosily rifle through my belongings and keep me company whilst I unpack and work out how much money I'm going to spend on shelving this month. 

(There are bean bags now. You can totally sit down in my place.)
