*[Permalinks for Pownce](http://gsfn.us/t/nzc)*

Remember the days when we all naively thought that ‘perma’ really would mean ‘permanent’?

The Pownce data export is coming, but the permalinks attached to all those posts will die with Pownce, unless they keep some sort of redirection system running. 

I doubt anyone will dispute it being a nice idea, but it would require Six Apart to keep a server running for ever to do it, so please show some support! I'm not sure that five agreements on GSFN will cut it… 

Thanks!
