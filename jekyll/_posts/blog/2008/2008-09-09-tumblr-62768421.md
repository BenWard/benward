Thanks to !FatBusinessman, you can in fact still disable the ‘Browse By Genre’ list and ‘Link to iTunes Store’ arrows in iTunes 8, there's just no UI for it in the Preferences any more.

Open up Terminal and run the following:

    $ defaults write com.apple.itunes show-genre-when-browsing -bool FALSE
    $ defaults write com.apple.iTunes show-store-arrow-links -bool FALSE

Restart iTunes and everything is back to relative tidiness.
