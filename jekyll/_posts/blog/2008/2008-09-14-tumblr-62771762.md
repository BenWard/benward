— I had a similar thought about Pownce. Though I come at it from the other side. My problem is that my blog has become a place more for longer articles and I don't want short snippets of ideas end up there.

I pondered getting working on my Tumblr account, but that fell down pretty quick when I realised Pownce has everything Tumblr has, but better, and with social integration and desktop/iPhone tools. For me, it's much easier to post to Pownce. And whilst I still feel that OEmbed should have built on Atom rather than invent a new vocabulary from scratch, it's used to excellent effect in posts too.

Which is to say, it's taken me ages, but I've figured out what Pownce is for. ‘Share stuff with your friends’ isn't the best tagline for it, but really it's right there at the birth of micro-blogging, which turns out to be a really good idea.
