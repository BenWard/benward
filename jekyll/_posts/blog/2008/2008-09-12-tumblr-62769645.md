I've taken to using Bazaar for most of my code. Local check ins for when I'm away from a net connection, and then a repository on my remote machine. In fact, though I've been rather lax in getting my most recent web server set up, it will, eventually, be running with each hosted web site deployed as a check out of the central repository. 

…Which is not rocket science, of course, but the thing I like about Bazaar (and my lazy understanding is that all the distributed VCS — hg, git… that other one — do this too) is how very, very easy it makes it to run a well structured repository/local-copy/deployment system just off storage, rather than needing to run any other server daemons running.
