*[http://microformats.org/wiki](http://microformats.org/wiki)*

This was a long time coming, but I've finally pushed the redesigned and updated microformats.org wiki live. This is satisfying both because I'm confident that it's a massive improvement on the old MediaWiki theme we used, and because it marks an important milestone in me announcing that I'm going to do something, and actually following through on it. 

And now, I shall sleep.
