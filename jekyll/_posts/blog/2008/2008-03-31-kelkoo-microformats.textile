After a slightly longer drafting period than I'd planned, my article "Kelkoo goes microformatic":http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2008/03/kelkoo_goes_mic.html has gone live on the "Yahoo! Developer Network blog":http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/.

It's a lengthy piece on the recent redevelopment of "Kelkoo":http://kelkoo.co.uk and the microformats we added to it. It's focused on the consumption of the formats though; putting them to use to build a related products widget for Kelkoo. That was my Hack Day <abbr title="Five">V</abbr> creation (up on "hack.ben-ward":http://hack.ben-ward.co.uk/listing/). I hope it provides a useful introduction to hListing, and the practical benefits of microformats in action.

Feedback so far has been excellent, so thank you to all who've linked it with kind words.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>cool stuff man, we just launched support as well. We don&#8217;t have 26M listings, but between UK and Spain we have well over 1M, which is a start.</p>
<p>Look forward to seeing some applications live as well.</p>
