*[Tumblweed](http://tumblweed.org/)*

So, the hope is to replace Pownce with Tumblr, it seems to be the closest match for microblogging. There's an excellent looking iPhone client, and Tumblweed is an Adobe AIR-based desktop app.

It's a bit strange. The UI is chunky, and it suffers all the usual problems of being built on AIR- misbehaving text fields and lack of system functions. That said, it does work for publishing.

The dream is a native Cocoa client. Before that, this will do.
