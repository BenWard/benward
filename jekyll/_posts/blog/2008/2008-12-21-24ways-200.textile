Along with an extremely turbulent week at work, I've also been putting together an article on bringing Fire Eagle to the client side for 24ways. Have a read of <a href="http://24ways.org/2008/geotag-everywhere-with-fire-eagle">Geotag everywhere with Fire Eagle</a> for a quick introduction to location based app building, and a guide through building a bookmarklet to bring your location into every web app you use today. It's something I think I'm going to carry on as a project, since the ideas I mention in the final paragraph are hopefully quite useful. We'll see how that goes over Christmas.
