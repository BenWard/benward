On a related note to all of this employment talk, I'm currently spending summer at home and trying to pay my way by taking on some small-scale web development jobs.

Therefore, if you've got some HTML/CSS needs fixing, templates building from Photoshop mockups, CMS theme building, PHP hacking or similar then drop an email to <a href="mailto:smalljobs@ben-ward.co.uk">smalljobs@ben-ward.co.uk</a> (you may like to peruse the <a href="/cv#skills">skills section of my CV</a>).

<p class="vevent" id="evAvailable">I'm <span class="summary">available</span> between <abbr class="dtstart" title="2006-07-14">now</abbr> and <abbr class="dtend" title="2006-08-18">August 18th</abbr></p>

<p class="vevent" id="evHoliday">From <abbr class="dtstart" title="2006-08-18">August 18th</abbr> to <abbr class="dtend" title="2006-08-28">August 28th</abbr> I'll be <span class="summary">on holiday with the family</span> but after that I'm available to work until such as time as I find a full time job.</p> 

This is all part of my strict ‘I'm never going back to work in McDonald's’ policy.
