<p class="vevent">Yes, the official conclusion to my university years is upon us and I'll be back in <span class="location">Manchester</span> for the day on <abbr class="dtstart" title="2006-07-10T10:00:00+01:00">Monday 10th</abbr> for my <abbr class="summary" title="Ben Ward's Graduation"><a class="url" href="http://manchester.ac.uk/graduation/">Graduation</a></abbr>. It's strange, for a long time I was a bit indifferent towards graduation, perhaps I'd just not really thought about it very much. Now I'm quite keen to stop into Manchester again, hopefully see a few people.</p>

Also, if you're _really, really bored_ on Monday morning at 10am, it transpires that <a href="http://manchester.ac.uk">the university</a> are doing a <a href="http://manchester.ac.uk/graduation/">live webcast of graduation ceremonies</a>. I've no idea how reliable or functional it is (it does use RealPlayerâ€¦). Regardless, since we're limited to only two guests each, I suspect my Grandparents will appreciate it.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Good to see you&#8217;re using <span class="caps">UMIST</span> logo rather than the new Uni one ;)</p>
<p>Apparently the live feed was quite good &#8211; my grandparents were watching it from the &#8216;live cinema link&#8217; in the Roscoe building.</p>
<p>Also, if you&#8217;re really, really, really bored at <em>any</em> time, you can watch the ceremony from the archive!</p></div>
