<q>The possibilities are endless</q>, sings Micah P Hinson out of my tinny iBook speakers. His voice echoes off the bare white walls of the room that was my home.

Tomorrow I'll leave this city that I've loved.

Good bye Manchester. At least for now.

<p>Good luck with whatever you do after Manchester, be it job hunting or lazing around for a while.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still in Manchester until mid-August at the latest, then it&#8217;s (for preference) move to my new job (hopefully in Worcestershire if I get the job I want) or fall back to my parent&#8217;s house near Bolton rather than pay an additional Â£75 per month rent (plus the extra fee for the short-term contract extension)!</p></div>
