I don't often make posts out of Spam, but this was just a touch too priceless.

The message reads: <q>Personally, I never use more than a single link in the comment I post because doing so can trigger spam catchers if the user has that plugin activated, whereas a single link will not.</q>

Needless to say, <a href="http://akismet.com">Akismet</a> caught it.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently got this one: subject: &#8220;whatever&#8221;; text-only content (of course it went right into the junk-mail folder): &#8220;buy viagra or die.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hilarious. Now that the spam doesn&#8217;t work so well any more, maybe some threats will help!</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had spam offering to sell me mailing lists. Wonder whether it&#8217;s the same mailing list they used to send me the spam?</p>
<p>Also had some &#8216;failed&#8217; spam that&#8217;s either not had a body, some haven&#8217;t even managed all of the headers, and I had one that attached an alternate <span class="caps">HTML</span> version to the email, only to leave the <span class="caps">HTML</span> version empty.</p>
<p>Most of the comment spam I had was fairly standard, though. Apart from the odd &#8220;like your site&#8230;..[insert random poker/drugs spam here]&#8221; comment.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>I just got a trackback spam for msn.com. Not a clue why anyone would do that &#8211; random crazy spammers.</p>
<p>Also, some of the junk filler in spam emails can be quite interesting in a completely odd way. It&#8217;s there to make the spam to normal word balance less spammy, but I posted some interesting ones on my forum (http://forums.hiveworldterra.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=666)</p></div>
