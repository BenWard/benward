Some time ago I stopped using Gmail. I was criticising it increasingly regularly and it seemed only right that I should explore alternatives. The alternative I've been settled on since then has been IMAP, in combination with Thunderbird on PC and Mail.app on the Mac. That's worthy of a separate post at some point, but one big step backwards I did find was the occasional need for webmail access.

Now, SquirrelMail I'm not a fan of. With that in mind, I'd been meaning to install <a href="http://roundcube.net">Roundcube</a> for a while. It's a beautiful new webmail system using quite lovely modern mark-up with a smattering of Ajax, drag & drop and a lovely mac-esque Pinstripe theme. It's reasonably responsive, as much as IMAP ever seems to be, and can load up larger IMAP folders without any time outs of memory overuse (a problem I have with SquirrelMail). Certainly it makes for a lovely interface to use when I've away from my main machine.

Disappointingly the JavaScript-licious UI doesn't degrade gracefully which means I can't use Roundcube in Opera Mini. It's a big downside for me, since SquirrelMail sucks in Opera Mini (all the header fields get cleared when you reply to a message). 

So, I'm still looking for a fast, clean and tidy IMAP webapp that functions purely in HTML and CSS. I'm tempted to see if Roundcube's core code is robust enough to build a static HTML interface from, but that requires time I'm unlikely to find. Recommendations?

      <div class="entry-content"><p>No recommendations sadly, but I feel your pain, I&#8217;m still searching for the ideal email setup, my needs are quite similar to yours (minus the PC) in that I need webmail in addition to app based access from two different machines.</p>
<p>I was kind of hoping roundcube would be the solution to part 1 of the dilemma, though I don&#8217;t tend to use my phone to check email, so RC might still work well enough for me, otherwise I&#8217;m thinking of headed down the Gmail on my domain route, which I know you aren&#8217;t a fan of!</p>
<p>How was installing roundcube by the way? I&#8217;ve still not got around to it!</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Roundcube was a doddle actually. I downloaded the latest build from <span class="caps">SVN</span> (which includes search), which admittedly isn&#8217;t the easiest thing ever but once you have the files it&#8217;s like installing any other webapp onto your server. Edit two configuration files (the instructions on the Roundcube site tell you which settings to edit: It&#8217;s just filling in your mail server and database server addresses really) and there&#8217;s one <span class="caps">SQL</span> script to execute through PHPMyAdmin or MySQL Query Browser, whichever is your flavour.</p>
<p>After that, it just worked. I was amazed.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Ben, I&#8217;m also in a similar situation (plus I would love to have my contacts shared between Windows Live Messenger, my email client, and my phone). I&#8217;m afraid no webmail solutions spring to mind, but I was wondering if your phone has a native email client that supports <span class="caps">IMAP</span> (or perhaps one could be downloaded), to save you using Opera Mini? That&#8217;s what I currently do, but granted <span class="caps">GPRS</span> is so expensive I really check my emails on the move.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>You may want to try IlohaMail. (http://blog.ilohamail.org/).  I think round cube is using their pure php based imap implementation.  I ran it for years and  as I remember it was a great, lightweight php webmail client.  Much better than squirrel mail.</p></div>
