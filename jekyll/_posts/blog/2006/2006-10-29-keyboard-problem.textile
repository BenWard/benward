I've been using my MacBook Pro at home with a Windows keyboard for a while now. It's been OK, although slightly annoying that the Cmd and Alt keys are reversed (which you can switch over, but that also reverses them on the Apple keyboard I use at work…).

More recently I've had one irritating problem though, namely that the keyboard is intermittently generating additional characters with key-presses. For example, pressing <kbd>space</kbd> just now produced a space character and a letter 'a'. Pressing it just then generated a 'space', followed by an 'a', followed by another 'space'. Pressing the shift, option or arrow key has produced similar results (often a number '3'). It happens more often when entering key combinations, but only sometimes. And it's not just modifier keys either. I got a handful of random characters when I hit 'a' a little while ago.

This is really annoying, since it makes my regular typo-habit seem so much worse. A little help?

      <div class="entry-content"><p>I had no idea you had a MacBook Pro. Very nice. I don&#8217;t mean to be a drag with my solution, however it&#8217;s a good one. You&#8217;re going to like it. I imagine you&#8217;ve already heard it. Ready? Ditch that windows keyboard and get yourself a nice little bluetooth Apple keyboard. They are so nice, and kinda portable. I&#8217;m hoping that this solution will improve your typo-habit and increase your productivity. Take it from me, I too used to be a windows keyboard witha  mac user until I discovered the joys of using an Apple kbd with an Apple product. If you need help on where and how to get one, let me know, and I&#8217;ll hook you up. Cheers!</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi William,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the MacBook Pro for just over a month now. It&#8217;s not really &#8216;mine&#8217; as such, as work paid. However, for all day-to-day intents and purposes, it&#8217;s mine :-) They can pry it from my cold, dead fingertips (or just ask nicely, I value my life).</p></div>
