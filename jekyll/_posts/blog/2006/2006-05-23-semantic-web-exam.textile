After a solid week of revision (which is a really big achievement for meâ€¦ just before my penultimate exam ever) I've just realised that most of the <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>, <abbr title="Resource Description Framework Schema">RDFS</abbr> and <abbr title="Web Ontology Language">OWL</abbr> references I've noted lately have been written in pseudo-XPath.

Sometimes even my own geek achievements amaze me.
