<a href="http://www.ellythompson.co.uk/blog/2006/04/23/where-was-i/">Elly tagged me</a> a few weeks ago with a quite interesting meme. Life has been terribly busy and it's taken until this attack of insomnia to find time to write it up.

So, without further dawdling, where was I…

<h2>…One year ago?</h2>
Last year was the industrial placement section of my degree, so rather than mid-term alcoholism in Manchester I was living in Bracknell and working for <a href="http://www.fujitsu-siemens.com">Fujitsu Siemens Computers</a>. Whilst there I met <a href="http://nascentguruism.com">Steve</a> and under his guidence became even nerdier than I already was.

It was a good year, although I would hazard a guess that in April we were still working on a dreadful Microsoft Sharepoint based project that was sapping the life and soul out of all of us. I would later describe Sharepoint deployments as ‘the kind of decision that could drive me out of a job’. This first experience merely drove me out of my mind.

<h2>… Five years ago?</h2>
At the fine age of seventeen I was studying for my AS-level exams at <a href="http://www.hrsfc.ac.uk">Hills Road Sixth Form College</a> in Cambridge. I was studing Maths, Computing, Modern History and Politics.

Items of interest include meeting <a href="http://fatbusinessman.com">David</a> on my computing course and, errr… hmm.

<h2>… Ten years ago?</h2>
I was twelve. This places me in the third term of my first year at Sawston Village College secondary school and probably means I had a terrible hair cut.

<h2>Who am I tagging?</h2>
It's rather late so I'm a bit stumped to think of five names. So for the time being:

* <a href="http://ibboard.co.uk">Stu</a>
* <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/beardmasterflex">Alex</a>
* and <a href="http://pinksocks.co.uk">Hanni</a>
