Somewhat surprisingly I'm attending @media again this year. Whoop whoop. It's nice to be seeing people again and this time there're some individuals I must ensure I track down properly. <a href="http://allthehead.com">Drew</a> and <a href="http://collylogic.com">Colly</a>, this means you.

Since my spot only revealed itself today I already had other plans to join in <a href="http://notmedia.kurafire.net">!Media</a> on Thursday afternoon and I'm sticking by that. Football in Hyde Park is go. I remembered to buy the football too, which is probably helpful in some way.

Basically, since my brief plan of attending the <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/63656/">Flickr Parisian Meetup</a> this weekend fell through, I'm treating <abbr title="At and Not Media">@/!Media</abbr> as a bit of a post-uni holiday. I'll be in London on Thursday and Friday and then enjoying a nice Saturday of tourism with <a href="http://kurafire.net">Faruk</a> and <a href="http://pinksocks.co.uk">Hanni</a> in the capital. For the most part I <em>fucking hate London</em>™, but in a capacity as a tourist I reckon it'll be a nice day.

If you're attending, I hope you enjoy it and look forward to meeting you.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Lucky you!  I remember badgering you into saving up for @media2006 last year.  Silly me, I thought my new, larger company would want to send me but no such luck.  Am so jealous of everyone who is there right now, while I&#8217;m sat at work.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy it.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Aw, that&#8217;s a shame Emma. I&#8217;ve not spoken to Paul yet, although I did walk passed him and had he not been deep in conversation with someone I was going to say ‘Hi’ and ask after you as well.</p>
<p>Ah well, perhaps next year then?</p></div>
