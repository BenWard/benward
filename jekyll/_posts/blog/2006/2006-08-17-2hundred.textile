<p class="vevent">I'm awful at drawing attention to milestones on my blog. I don't see an awful lot of importance or relevance in doing so, but would anyway if I were to remember. I missed the first <span class="summary">blog anniversary</span>, and the second too (<abbr class="dtstart" title="2004-07-21">July 21st</abbr>) but pretty much by accident, I spotted the post count in Wordpress sitting at 199.</p>

So this is it. Two hundred posts published on Ben-Ward.co.uk. Qualityâ€¦ variable.
