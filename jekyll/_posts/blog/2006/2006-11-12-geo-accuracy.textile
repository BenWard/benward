With all this talk of geotagging, I've a lazy web question for you. Take the following case:

I went on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/benward/tags/malta">holiday to Malta</a> back in the summer. Thanks to Google Earth I've managed to geotag some of the photos to the precise location of the hotel we stayed in. In fact, I could target particular sun loungers using GE if so inclined.

Problem is though, I don't know exactly where the other photos were taken. Some I'm not even sure which part of the country we were in. So I want to geotag them as being taken in Malta, but <em>not</em> of being at the precise spot in Malta my cursor is hovering over.

How do I do this? Perhaps by reducing the precision of the number. But does Flickr et al understand that? Would it treat the vague value '1.39' just the same as the precise value '1.390000'?

I like geotagging. I want to make as much use of it as I can. But I don't want to invalidate the entire concept by having photos tagged to a 10 cm^2 patch of earth when really they can only be generalised to an entire island.

Any advice?

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi Ben</p>
<p>No practical suggestions, I&#8217;m afraid, but <a href="http://www.geospatialexperts.com/ricoh.html" rel="nofollow">Ricoh</a> have developed a digital camera with built-in <span class="caps">GPS</span>. The camera quality doesn&#8217;t look up to much, and the package seems a little cumbersome, but it&#8217;s an interesting step (plus it&#8217;s compatible with Google Earth).</p>
<p>In the future you may also be able to use things like Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/" rel="nofollow">Photosynth</a>, which can look for similarities in your photos with those elsewhere in your collection or online. Not only does this allow the creation of 3D representations of a space based on your photos, but if you can cross-match with a known location then it provides a more accurate <span class="caps">GPS</span> location (although it obviously ceases being so cool when you step inside or into more obscure places).</p>
<p>In the meantime, I hope you find a suitable solution! Happy tagging!</p></div>
