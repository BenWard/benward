The make-up of an Englishman varies dramatically depending on the context of the appending blog post, but right now let's say it's 33% fine roast meat, 33% penalty shoot outs and 34% whinging about the weather.

This has been an outstanding week for weather gripes in England. We're having a pretty staggering heat wave and there's no breeze so none of us can sleep in 23Ëš temperatures. Yet we still managed to rain off the first day of our annual tennis tournament.

What it is to be English.

<p>As for an Englishman&#8217;s makeup, I think it&#8217;s only a select few like Eddie Izzard who go for that look ;)</p>
<p>On the plus side (since I&#8217;m reading this a little late) Rooney deserved it, and it&#8217;s rained since then, or at least cooled down.</p></div>
