It's been a while since a meme went around this bit of the internet. It's something to do with "Oxton":http://joshuaink.com syphoning "votes":http://2006.bloggies.com from teenagers and/or the easily deceived.

# Web Developer

h2. Four films I can watch over and over
* Star Wars - Empire Strikes Back
* Dodgeball
* Evolution
* The Matrix

h2. Four TV shows I love to watch

h2. Four of my favourite dishes
* Roast Beef (pink, but after the point at which �blood� becomes �juices�, see?). Usual trimmings, plus fried cabbage+bacon (which cameos as a �favourite side-dish�)
