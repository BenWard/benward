The <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com/summit">Carson Summit</a> draws closer and people are starting to make plans for meet-ups and birthday parties. Mostly meet-ups though.

<a href="http://nathanpitman.com">Nathan Pitman</a> has started <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/summit2006/">a handy group on Flickr</a> to pop in a mugshot if you're looking to be recognised.
