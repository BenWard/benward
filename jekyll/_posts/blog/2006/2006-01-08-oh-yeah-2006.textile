I haven't blogged anything yet this year, mostly because there's been nothing to say. 2006, frankly, feels so much like 2005 I think it's the least significant new year I've ever had.

That said, having moved back up to Manchester a few weeks early to revise for some exams, I've started to get things in order and review what�s on offer from the year ahead:

* Not making a student loan budget last term has hurt and means I can't spend any money until about May. It's my own stupid fault, of course, but I suspect I'll be eating a lot of pasta from here on. The immediate aftermath of this discovery is the near-overwhelming desire to buy an iPod Shuffle for the gym, just so I can sync it with <a href="http://last.fm">Last.FM</a> afterwards, which my phone's media player won't.
* The first exam is just over a week away. It's going to be hard and there's a lot to cover. But as I read through the material I don't feel overly stupid, which I think that's a good thing.
* Oak (my final year project, desktop search tool) needs some progress. The design remains solid (apart, possibly from the choice of a Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express database. There may be a late change coming up�). Regardless of backend technology, there should be a beta 1 around the 28th of February, and then two more releases over the following weeks.
* ResinTheBand.com is up for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/benward/83589062/in/set-1785485/">a Wordpress based refresh</a>. The site exists partly to offer up as an example of my work and because the current site has some severe faults, I want to fix them out of shame before a prospective employer uses it against me�
* There's the Carson Summit on February 8th. That's going to be very interesting indeed with a lot of extremely influential and inspirational people there. I understand there will be a substantial social afterwards, which conveniently runs into my birthday on the 9th (just in case anyone was mistaken that I might be settling my beer debt).
* I'm almost certainly going to travel for short-bit over the summer. New Zealand is an option (although it won't be a prime time of year over there, of course) although the front runner is Iceland (perhaps with some of Scandinavia thrown in). <a href="http://collylogic.com">Colly</a> is so enthusiastic that I go there, I may yet hire him as a guide (for �hire� read �kidnap or blackmail�, see the above point about having no money).

Which all means that from having had a fairly sedate Christmas break at home with the family, life has very suddenly got busy again. I don't really know how it happened�

Happy (belated) New Year.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>First exam&#8217;s Requirements Eng, I take it (either that or you&#8217;re fitting something in before 9:45 on the 16th :D) It doesn&#8217;t seem too bad so far, but then again it does. There&#8217;s a lot of paper to the notes, but a lot of it doesn&#8217;t seem to say very much. A big chunk of it just seems to be the modelling stuff as well, which is mostly a minor extension on the previous ER diagrams.</p>
<p>Meh, who knows what the exam&#8217;ll be like. Maybe I should check out some past papers at some point!</p></div>
