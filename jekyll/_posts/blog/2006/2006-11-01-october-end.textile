It's end of October, which means the end of <a href="http://pinkforoctober.org">Pink for October</a>, an effort to promote <a href="http://nbcam.org/">National Breast Cancel Awareness Month</a>.

My 'redesign' was a garish bodge of the regular design so I've lost no hast in switching back to my regular blues. I have a lot of respect for people like <a href="http://ifelse.co.uk/">Phu Ly</a> who created something far more subtle and beautiful for the campaign and now has a pink-tinged design that will look great for months to come.

So, thank you to Matthew Oliphant for organising Pink for October and doing something to really spread awareness (at the very least, to people like me who read up a little before taking part).
