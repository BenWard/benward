Since <a href="http://hanniross.com">Hanni's blogging</a> is rather low-key since her pinksocks.co.uk domain combusted, I'll drop a little pointer towards Hanni <a href="http://hanniross.com/notes/thank-you-conspirators/">saying thank you</a> for the camera we got her last week. She's also said it <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hanni/294592144/">photographically</a>.
