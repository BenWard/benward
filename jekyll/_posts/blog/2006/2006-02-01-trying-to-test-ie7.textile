<img class="splash" src="/media/splashes/ie7.splash.png" alt="A post about Internet Explorer 7." />I want to test <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie7/default.mspx">Microsoft's new browser</a> very much. I'm a web developer, so being aware of bleeding edge technology like this is important, especially in the context of Internet Explorer 7 which brings with it big changes.

Unfortunately, some years ago Microsoft made a terrible engineering decision that means you can't run two different versions of Internet Explorer alongside each other in the same Windows installation. Thus, the only way to run <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>7 in anything close to a �standalone� mode, is to use Microsoft's Virtual PC product. This allows you to have a second copy of Windows running in a window on your main system's desktop. It's useful and keeps your main system's files safe while you're testing something.

Except, there's a big catch. Some years ago Microsoft made a terrible engineering decision that involves imposing product activation on Windows XP. This means you can only have Windows installed on one computer at a time. Not unreasonable in itself, until you realise that a Virtual PC installation of Windows is apparently identical to "one computer". Therefore, I can't install my existing copy of Windows through Virtual PC, because I'm already using it on the computer on which Virtual PC is running. Follow?

So, I can't activate Windows. It'll still functional for 30 days though, right? Wrong.  I tried installing the IE7 beta. To install, it requires something called a Windows Genuine Advantage validation check. This is a new thing Microsoft have come up with to stop software pirates getting non-critical updates for Windows. Guess the prerequisite? Activation.

I'm lucky enough to have a copy of Virtual PC through Microsoft's Academic Alliance scheme. That means it's free. Although, if I want to continue using it after I graduate, it will cost �100 for a full license. Next, add an additional license for Windows XP: Also �100. <em>But</em>, a Virtual PC probably doesn't quality for an OEM license (they're for system builders), so instead crank up the Windows license fee to <strong>�250</strong> for the full boxed version.

What I'm trying to say is this: <strong>It costs �350 to legally test Microsoft's shit software in a safe testing environment</strong>. Here we are, locked in to testing for Microsoft's terrible but dominant browser and that's the tax we�re supposed to pay for it. How did they ever get away with this?

<strong>Update</strong>: Thank you for all the suggestions regarding hacked standalone versions of Internet Explorer. I've actually used these for a long time for testing old versions of IE, the purpose of this entry was to emphasise how ridiculous the only <em>supported</em> mechanism is for testing IE7. I had a genuine desire to �do it properly� this time.

Anyway, since �doing it properly� is rarely a sentence associated with <em>any</em> version of Internet Explorer, I've instead got it running by following <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2005/12/28/434132.aspx">these instructions from Jon Galloway</a>. The only downside is that it requires you to <abbr title="substitute user identity">su</abbr> into an account with Administrative privileges or else IE7 crashes out instantly. I assume that's a side affect of the hack, not an incredible oversight in the implementation of IE7.

<strong>Update 2</strong>: Ooooor not. Jon Galloway's trick, which is known to work with beta 1 and was then modified so as not to fuck up IE6 with beta 2 actually worked for me� (wait for it)� once. Just once. From then on, <abbr title="IE7 beta 2">IE7b2</abbr> crashes out every time you try to start it. Apparently that's a widely reported change from beta 1, where you _could_ run it standalone like this. I'm going to return to my original "fuck Microsoft" position and sulk.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Phil,</p>
<p>The quirksmode hacks do exist, it&#8217;s true. There are two key things:</p>
<ol>
	<li>They&#8217;re not official, and last night&#8217;s IE7 experience reinforced just how much of a mistake not releasing IE standalones really is. For a company that normally serves developers very well, Microsoft really dropped the ball.</li>
	<li>The hacked versions of IE <em>generally</em> work (I have 4.0, 5.0 and 5.5 on my system), except in the case of conditional comments: Which is Microsoft&#8217;s new favourite way of filtering <span class="caps">CSS</span> to different versions of IE, instead of using the <code>* html</code> hack. (The problem is that regardless of which version of IE you run, it adopts the version number of the most recent version of IE on your system: So all versions of IE on my system treat conditional comments as IE6).</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, it may be that someone worked out how to fix conditional comments. If so, that&#8217;s makes the hack IE&#8217;s a valid workaround again. I have half and inkling that I read about a way to make them work and forgot to mark it in Delicious (as I tend to). Even then, I&#8217;m pretty sure it involved gigantic registry hacking, appeasement of ancient Gods and following a complex set of movements that may or may not be the dance routine to Steps <i>5, 6, 7, 8</i>.</p>
<p>They should get it fixed, officially. And soon.</p></div>
