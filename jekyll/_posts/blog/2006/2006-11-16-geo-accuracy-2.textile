<blockquote cite=""><p class="song-lyrics">Hello, welcome to dial-a-view
To locate the area in which you wish to observe
You must program in the longitude and the latitude
For a closer, more detailed picture
Use either the zoom or micro-zoom controls
Good luck</p></blockquote><cite>‘Miner at the Dial-a-View’ – Grandaddy</cite>

Following my <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/journal/geo-accuracy/" rel="me">pondering about Geo-Accuracy</a> earlier in the week, I've finished geotagging (almost all) <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/benward/map">my Flickr photos</a> and spent a bit of time whether some sort of representation of inaccuracy could be incorporated gracefully into the geo  <a href="http://microformats.org">microformat</a>.

Meanwhile on Flickr, I accidentally  discovered this:

<blockquote cite="http://flickr.com/photos/organize/"><p><img src="/res/i/FlickrGeoZoom.png" alt="Wait a moment! We recommend that you place your photos on the map at a higher accuracy level (zoomed in closer). If you drop your photos here, they won't be seen as people zoom in, because it's no clear where they were actually taken. Are you sure you'd like to drop your photo/photos here?" title="Flickr geotagger warning message "/></p></blockquote><cite>Warning message from the Flickr Organizr tool</cite>

So the wonderful revelation is that Flickr already looks out for vague, less accurate geotagging, allowing you to flag something as inaccurate  but still make use of the mapping features. That's very well thought out. I wonder  if they express it through the API, or in mark-up, or if it's just a background flag.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>I guess they should really allow tagging with a bounding-box, two pairs of lon/lat coordinates at diagonal opposites of a box.</p>
<p>Do they allow for searching for photos within an area, or any other kind of spatial query?</p></div>
