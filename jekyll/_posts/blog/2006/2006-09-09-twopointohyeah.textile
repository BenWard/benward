<a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org">d.Construct</a> was an absolute blast and I'll try to write it up properly soon. Meanwhile, I have to move to Birmingham so I've been trying to finish the website for <a href="http://36-degrees.co.uk">Stuart</a> and my little side project.

<strong>Presenting <a href="http://twopointohyeah.com">Two Point <em>Oh Yeah</em></a>! T-Shirts for the AJAX generation.</strong>

A few of us have been wearing the tees for a week now and the ‘Well Fed’ feed icon design has gone down a storm. We've not got the website how we'd like it just yet, but since demand is there we've got a placeholder to tide you over and you can buy the shirts directly from Spreadshirt who're doing the printing.

There are separate stores for the <a href="http://twopointohyeah.spreadshirt.com">US</a> and <a href="http://twopointohyeah.spreadshirt.net">European</a> orders, so import taxes and transatlantic shipping need not be a problem.

The full website will drop in a week or so at <a href="http://twopointohyeah.com">twopointohyeah.com</a>, once I've moved and regained internet access.

Enjoy!
