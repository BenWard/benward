Well, it's a special time of year because it's <a href="http://hanniross.com">her</a> birthday on Monday. It's a special kind of age so I was a bit naughty and approached a lot of people to give me money. A wiser man would've stopped there, but with a bit of help from her Dad passing through the states, the money has instead been spent. We've bought her a Canon EOS 400D (or ‘Digital Rebel XTi’ as the nutcase American marketeers have badged it).

Needless to say, I <em>think</em> she was pleased about it:

I'd like to take the opportunity to say a <strong>huge</strong> thank you to everyone who put money in the pot. I honestly didn't expect us to raise enough for the camera; at best I though it would be a helping push for Hanni's own saving. But the generosity was incredible and she got the real thing instead. Thank you, so much. You've all made her very happy indeed (and me as well, for what that's worth).

The birthday proper is Monday, if you want to bombard her with greetings you'll find she's contactable in many ways from <a href="http://hanniross.com">her website</a>.
