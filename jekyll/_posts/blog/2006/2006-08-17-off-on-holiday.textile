<img class="splash" src="/res/splashes/Sandcastles.splash.png" alt=""/> After a gruelling graduation ceremony, some casual small-job work, casually hunted for full time jobs and spending a lot of time <a href="http://hanniross.com">cuddling</a>, I need a holiday.

<p class="vevent">Therefore, I'm <span class="summary">off on holiday</span> to <span class="location">Malta</span> with my family <abbr class="dtstart" title="2006-08-18">tomorrow</abbr> until <abbr class="dtend" title="2006-08-28">the 28th</abbr>.</p>

I've not set an auto-response on my email because right now I'm subscribed to mailing lists with it as well and there's nothing more irritating than getting holiday auto-responses through mailing lists. I vow to sort out my list addresses soon, but for now I hope you'll accept this post as notification that I won't be answering any email for a week.

Best wishes for the week.
