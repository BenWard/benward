I shall say this only once, or perhaps thrice:

<strong>Just because MySpace is irreconcilably popular, does not mean that you - a band - can cop out and present it in place of a proper web site.</strong>

<a href="http://www.lisabrown.net/">Lisa Brown/Snowfight in the City Centre</a>, I'm looking it you. It's <em>really annoying</em>.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah, it is a poor show for them to end up doing that. My Vitriol used to have a proper website, but now MyVitriol.com is just a load of press quotes and a link to their MySpace page. Although, even worse with MyVitriol is the style that they&#8217;ve changed it to at some point between now and my last visit a few months ago :| and the performance on the scroll isn&#8217;t too great in Firefox either (too much random scrolling Flash)</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>While I&#8217;m on here, I&#8217;ll also take this chance to slag of myspace. Who decided it was a good idea? It looks utterly shite, is a stupid idea (a better format would be just to have a searchable directory of <span class="caps">PROPER</span> band websites), and to cap it all it&#8217;s owned by Rupert Murdoch. Pah!</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Rupert Murdoch? <span class="caps">LOL</span>, that&#8217;d sound about right.</p>
<p>MySpace does seem like a place for whining emo kids, though. There&#8217;s someone on the FileFront forums who came in, asked for something, started complaining when people were trying to help him do it himself (because it was a fairly simple thing) and then he went off on a rant saying about how he didn&#8217;t care and how he had his MySpace, yada yada yada!</p>
<p>Some kids these days&#8230; :D</p></div>
