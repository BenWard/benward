Pfffffffffft.

That's pretty much all I have to say on the matter. Were it not for some other things.

First, I noticed today that there are some commentators outside of Europe reacting as if the whole of Europe has lost its mind. As I suspect <em>most</em> international observers can tell, �Europe's� little ruckus with Islam does <em>not</em> actually involve every resident of our fair continent. Just because there's some buildings on fire on the tee-vee, doesn't mean that every reasonable person in Europe has jumped into the sea out of shame.

No, we're all still here. However, photographs of bemused Brits sitting on the sofa and rolling their eyes does not newspapers sell.

Second, Paul Haine <a href="http://joeblade.com/286/the-long-dark/">phrased the issue so brilliantly</a> that I feel compelled to quote it:

<blockquote cite="http://joeblade.com/286/the-long-dark/"><p>I don�t even know where to begin with the whole Muslim/Danish cartoon issue, except to perhaps suggest that everyone involved on both sides is being a <em>bit</em> overexcited and if they don�t pack it in right now I�m going to have to pull over.</p></blockquote>

Frankly, I wish the whole thing would just blow over. I quite accept that some people are keen to fight the bigger battle about censorship vs. free speech vs. religion vs. Chuck Norris, but I'd really rather they didn't. Not over some cartoons that weren't even very clever to start with.

What was I saying? Ah yes, pffffft.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Chuck Norris? Who&#8217;s he and why is he so important?</p>
<p>As for the cartoons, I&#8217;m just glad that Christians don&#8217;t have a commandment that says &#8220;do not depict God or Jesus&#8221;, otherwise we&#8217;d have this a heck of a lot more!</p>
<p>Freedom of speech is one thing, but annoying another religious group by doing something they consider unholy is another :D</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure why Chuck Norris is so important, I think I&#8217;m too young, or just missed some vital piece of television in the past. Either way, he appears to be a cult hero and who am I to deny a bandwagon? Unless that bandwagon involves setting fire to Danish Embassies, of course.</p>
<p>One quite obvious thing struck me full on a few hours after writing all this, deliberately short on in-depth analysis as it is. It&#8217;s the utter irony failure on the part of those Muslims protesting with violent placards. Someone satires your religion&#8217;s debatably inevitable link to terrorism, you respond by burning buildings and inciting murder. <em>Good job�</em></p>
<p>Watch for the front page photographs in a few days when one man in the middle of the mob stops throwing rocks, pauses, raises his finger and the air and proclaims &#8220;Waaaaaaaait just a minute&#8221;.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Just as a matter of interest, it&#8217;s not only Europe that&#8217;s in the &#8220;hot seat&#8221;&#8230; Some newspaper in South Africa also published exactly the same cartoon, so there&#8217;s some trouble over here too. Luckily we have not seen any firestarting over here. :)</p>
<p>Personally I don&#8217;t have anything against the Muslims protesting (at least they are willing to stand up for what they believe in) but &#8220;burning down the house&#8221; is taking things to the next level. The wrong level.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Their action send out the best possible message: you offend our religion we respond by threatening to kill the people and their families. How could that ever be considered reasonable behaviour? Yes, its good that they stand up for what they believe in, but surely there are limits &#8211; especially in what is supposed a &#8216;civilised democracy&#8217;. Yes there are links to extremism within Islam, but aren&#8217;t their in every religion? Surely this just promotes the side of their faith that has so been under scrutiny recently? The whole issue of <span class="caps">WRONG</span> <span class="caps">IMAGE</span>.<br />
Anyway, these were cartoons. The way they were dealt with was insensitive, especially as you know that this was going to upset a large proportion of society, but i still believe in the right to free speech. I just think they should have looked at what they were doing and thought a little bit more about it. And even if it did happen with Christianity, and isn&#8217;t there that law that is like &#8217;don&#8217;t make false idols&#8217; which could kindof relate to the whole dancingjesus merchendise ness, except modern day Christianity is adapting to society and its attitudes.<br />
I think i&#8217;m just going to agree on pfft.</p>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Absolutely Phoebe, I swear if I ever come face to face with a ‘you called our religion violent so here&#8217;s a violent response’ misfit I&#8217;m going step on their foot with my <em>size 11 irony boots</em>. I wish people would make more jokes about it, I really do, perhaps making them slightly more obvious each week until finally the eegit in the street with the Molotov cocktail achieves his moment of zen (hopefully before igniting the aforementioned firebomb). Unfortunately there seem to be a bit of restraint in action.</p>
<p>The Christianity thing is ‘do not <em>worship</em> false idols’ if I remember correctly, so dancing Jesii probably aren&#8217;t covered. That doesn&#8217;t mean the churches don&#8217;t disapprove of them, but it&#8217;s not the same as breaking a taboo that seems to be quite so strictly observed in the East.</p>
<p>The point about Christianity and adapting to society is true to a degree. As best I can tell, most practicing Christians in Britain are well adapted to the realities of the world, but whether actual Christian authorities are is less clear cut. The Vatican have done some fucking disgraceful things in Africa regarding contraception and AIDs that doesn&#8217;t seem to support much integration with reality. Of course, Christian centres of authority have passed their time of power in the West. Whereas Islamic power centres are much stronger to proliferate this kind of nonsense.</p>
<p>You also have to remember that this is a country built on Christian foundations. It must be said, these are pretty good foundations regardless of the religious origins, but it&#8217;s still a consideration when considering that it&#8217;s perhaps easier for Christians to flow in this society than Muslims.</p>
<p>Anyway, none of this is any excuse for the irony failure suffered by the minority on the streets. Or for those opportunists in the East who&#8217;ve just started <em>making stuff up</em> to support the uprising.</p></div>
