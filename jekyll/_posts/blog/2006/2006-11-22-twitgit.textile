I've been working for a week or so now on learning to build Dashboard widgets for Mac OSX. I've got one for the rather incredible <a href="http://last.fm">Last.FM</a> in the works, but since it's quite complex I took time out for something simpler.

Announcing <a href="/widgets/twitgit" title="Twitgit Dashboard Widget">Twitgit</a>! A Dashboard widget for everyone's favourite Web 2.0 time-waster, <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>. 

<img class="screenshot" src="/res/posts/twitgit/Twitgit05.png" title="Twitgit 0.5 for OSX Dashboard alt="" />

Amusingly, the original name, <a href="http://www.frankmanno.com/widgets/twidget/">Twidget</a>, was already taken as of about 6 hours before Twitgit's release. A hasty name change ensued, along with a bit of polish and a few compromises. I'm calling in 0.5, and will try to do a fresh release every few days (give or take) with improvements and then call it ‘done’ in a week. This is what they call <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/11/beta_excuse">buggy</a> software, so please be nice.

<a href="/files/widgets/Twitgit.zip">Download Twitgit 0.5 for Twitter</a>

The <a href="/widgets/twitgit">Twitgit page</a> documents a few initial to-dos, so if you've got feature requests please take a look there in case it's already covered (scroll bars <em>are</em> already on the list). Feel free to post feedback here or <a href="/widgets/twitgit">on the project page</a>.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>My only fear with this is &#8211; and perhaps this was completely intentional &#8211; is that it makes Twitter seem a chat client.  I believe it&#8217;s original purpose was to show the current status of it&#8217;s members.</p>
<p>Again, the ability to IM in your statuses (thought of as a matter of convieneance from the developers no doubt), does the same thing as this widget does.  Makes Twitter into a huge Chatroom.</p>
<p>Nice job on the widget, I&#8217;ll probably end up using it&#8230;. but I got sucked into using Twitter to chat and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be using it like that ever again.  Huge waste of time.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Colin: It&#8217;s interesting you think that because for me, one of the reasons for building the widget was to try and get a llittle away from the ‘chat instinct’ that I found when Twitter was integrated into my IM client. For me, at least the widget is in a different place, even though the information is the same.</p>
<p>Personally, I think in a week or so Twitter will naturally settle down again and return to something that&#8217;s at least nearer the original purpose; at the moment there are bundles of new people signing up enthusiastically every day and it takes everyone a little while to realise that the differing friends lists make it less suitable for all out public chat. Which isn&#8217;t to say the exchange of messages is bad; I do love the way that if you&#8217;re pondering something that can get an answer, you can often get little suggestions back.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>To say that Twidgit makes Twitter feel like a chatroom as much, or more than, via IM is not fair.  Twidgit definitely makes Twitter feel less like a chat room than getting statuses via IM.  For sure.</p>
<p>Looking forward to future releases.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m loving Twitgit. The constant hassling that my IM client was giving me was far too distracting.</p>
<p>One suggestion would be to replace the &#8220;Refreshing Twitterings&#8221; With an absolutely positioned throbber (spinning disc) in the top right hand corner. This will then not push down the content (which is a distraction in itself) and will also alleviate the cut-off problem in 0.5</p>
<p>Thanks for building this Ben, it&#8217;s now my preferred method for Twittering.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks Stuart, it&#8217;s nice to have produced something useful.</p>
<p>Two things in the works to fix your problem: Once I get scrollbars in I can fix the height of the widget (resizing will come later) and the notification bar will be redone with position:fixed to make it overlay rather than push down. It&#8217;s used to display errors as well as the &#8216;Refreshing&#8217;.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Refreshing&#8217; will go, and be replaced with another kind of activity indicator. I&#8217;ve got a fair bit of train travel to do this weekend, so I&#8217;ll take a local copy of the <span class="caps">JSON</span> and hack away on the train.</p></div>
