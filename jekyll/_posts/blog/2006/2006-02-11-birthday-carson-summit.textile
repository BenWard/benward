This is gonna be pretty short but I should say that I had a great time at the Carson Web Apps Summit. It's always nice to meet up with other geeks and indulge, combining that with my birthday seems to have been a good mix. I should eat at Wagamana more often, too.

Need to say a big thank you to <a href="http://nascentguruism.com">Steve</a> and <a href="http://fatbusinessman.com">Fatty</a> for buying me a copy of <a href="http://domscripting.com">DOM Scripting</a>, and thanks to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/benward/98412052/">everyone who signed it</a>. I was going to list names, but there are names I just can't decipher. Also, if anyone out there finds themselves in possession of <a href="http://www.cssmastery.com/">another Clearleft book</a>, _do_ get <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy</a> to sign it as I suspect he'll appreciate the opportunity for witty revenge.

<p>I don&#8217;t understand most of the handwriting either on the photo, but I guess that&#8217;s the whole point of having a &#8220;signature&#8221;. :D</p></div>
