I'm still no nearer to reskinning and enhancing this Blog I'm afraid. Josh's <a href="http://www.resintheband.com" title="Resin">ResinTheBand.com</a> site is still in need of having its content completed and my iTunes-related app is progressing a little each week too.

I have done a little tweaking to the current skin though, was kinda hoping that I could've got the layout to scale with font-size using em measurements, but that's too much for a tweak, sadly. Roll on the rewrite and flexible (or maybe flowing, depending on how arty I feel and how interested I am in writing a flex layout).

Anyway, some redundant links are gone, the "Ben-Ward" at the top will now link you back to the homepage and I've shifted Search up nearer the top where it should be.

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Talking of &#8216;em&#8217; measurements, I think most browsers should include an implementation of Opera&#8217;s page zoom, which instead of just altering the text size, alters every aspect of the page so it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re viewing and zooming a <span class="caps">PDF</span>/Word document etc. It&#8217;s the best of both worlds, as text size can increase, even pixel sizes I <strong>think</strong>, but designers can rest assured their layout won&#8217;t break. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it is still a very nifty feature :)</p>
<p>As for the tweaks to this site, they&#8217;re looking good! Just one silly thing, the heading link &#8216;Ben-Ward.co.uk&#8217; appears black on Linux Mozilla 1.0.2 (not my default browser!). Probably just styles overlapping or defaulting, though, nothing major.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work!</p></div>
