… I highly recommend you <a href="http://www.preparingforemergencies.co.uk" title="Preparing for Emergencies">Prepare for an Emergency!</a>.

Inspired by a <a href="http://www.preparingforemergencies.gov.uk" title="Preparing for Emergencies.GOV.uk">remarkably similar campaign</a>, PFE offers useful advice on fire: <q>Reduce fire hazards in your home. Children are the worst fire hazards; consider giving them up for adoption.</q>; Bombs:  <q>If you are trapped in debris: Swear profusely. Try not to die.</q>; Emergencies: <q>Look, it's an emergency. How are you supposed to prepare for it? It's in the bloody dictionary. " A serious situation or occurrence that happens unexpectedly and demands immediate action." If you expect it, it's not an emergency, is it? Honestly.</q>

I feel safer already. Don't you?
