From <cite>Tom McRae</cite>'s weblog. Without a doubt my favourite 'wintertime' artist (his songs don't seem quite right in summer). For a man who writes such dark lyrics, he has a black but quite hilarious sense of humour. Since he's not got a new album out yet (though he is touring this autumn), I figured I'd offer him some promotion based on his humour talents instead.

His online diary can be found on <a href="http://www.tommcrae.com" title="Tom McRae dot Com">his website</a>, though you will need to sign up on the forum to read it. Tabs, galleries and other stuff can be found without any effort, though.

<blockquote cite="http://www.tommcrae.com/diary.php">Ive been having the same dream recently, about this girl who drowns. Maybe this place is haunted, God knows there are enough ghosts stalking the streets of Hollywood Boulevard, but its bad enough we have skunks. Really. My friend Polly says that maybe the girl wanted me to write her a song, so I did, and the dreams stopped. Thing is, the next night I dreamed of a hundred other dead people all clamouring for songs. and they were all demanding radio hits. Just my luck to be haunted by a legion of undead A&amp;R men.

Think I need to stop drinking.</blockquote>
