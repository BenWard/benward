Oh bloody <em>hell</em>.
<!--more-->
I initially wrote rather a long rant here. It was rather harsh on America and Bush voters. I still stand by everything I said, but it was ultimately purposeless in publication. Therefore I'm leaving just the following abridged paragraph, and a question. The question is "Why?".

The paragraph is:

<blockquote>If you voted for Bush, you're an idiot. Just like him. Every anti-Bush, anti-you rant published on this fine Internet medium is echoed by me, at <em>you</em>. If it all goes up in flames, then there's blood on your hands.</blockquote>

Short.
