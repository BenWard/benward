Some time ago in my <a href="http://www.studentssocial.co.uk" title="Students' Social">Students' Social</a> column I raved about spell checker extension for <a href="http://getfirefox.com" title="Mozilla Firefox Web Browser">Firefox</a>. When the 0.9 <acronym title="Firefox">FX</acronym> update came the spell checker lost compatibility and my spelling went to pot.

It was with some delight therefore that I came across <a href="http://www.exchangecode.com/spellbound/" title="Spellbound">Spellbound</a>, which does the same job and whose website also makes installation an utter doddle. Pick languages, install the extensions all at once (we <em>like</em> the new extension manager muchly), restart and like magic, I can spell again.

I love this browser.
