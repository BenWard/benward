On mentioning my current habit of writing <a href="http://www.nme.com" title="The New Musical Express Website">NME</a> bashing song lyrics, Sarah just recited me this poem.

<blockquote>I'm sleeping with the nme tucked underneath my bed, 
and while I sleep it tries to put opinions in my head</blockquote>

If anyone happens to have the rest of that poem, I'd be glad to hear it. Google has failed on this count.
