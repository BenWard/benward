The side affect of my <a href="http://www.fujitsu-siemens.co.uk" title="Fujitsu Siemens Computers">new job</a> is that I now have less debt. In a month or two, I will back in the black for the first time in about 14 months. It's a really nice feeling, tarnished only by my unquenchable thirst to spend it all.

While people at work have suggested giving up on the 'return to Uni with some money' idea, I don't really want to go back as broke as I left.

When <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/" title="Apple Computer. Not Shit.">Apple</a> cut the prices on <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod" title="iPod. Also Not Shit.">iPods</a> and introduce a stunning new line of <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays" title="Apple Cinema Displays. Just LOOK at them. No pun intended.">Cinema Displays</a> starting at <abbr title="More money than I have">999.</abbr> Arrgh.

<img src="/media/ipod.jpg" alt="iPod" title="iPod 4G"   class="splash" />Thankfully, with this being a placement and all, 999 is more than I earn in a month and so is definitely <strong>not</strong> going to happen. However, the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/Products/Monitor/LCDMonitor/Monitor_LCDMonitor_172X.htm" title="Samsung 172X Product Page">Samsung 172X</a> is an altogether more reasonable 350. Sure, it's <i>only</i> 17", but on the other hand, you could have two of these, a new 4G iPod and feed myself for two and a half weeks for <em>less</em> that the aforementioned Cinema display. I think we have a winner, but I also have a feeling that I'm going to selling myself out as a freelance web developer to pay for number 2 next summer.

'y spare change?
