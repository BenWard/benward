The regularity of stop-me-in-my-tracks IE bugs is starting to drag.

<img src="/media/ieclear.jpg" alt="IE Clear Bug Screenshot" />

The photograph is set to float on the right, the text in &lt;div&gt; tags is set to clear on the left only. Firefox and Opera happily wrap around the photo; Internet Explorer makes the fricking box bigger, pushing the news content down the page.

I tolerate most bugs and work around them, but this ones makes the layout truely unacceptable. I hate it.

<p>Check out this page (it is not mine), which has a very good hack/fix for that bug.<br />
Oh how I hate IE.  Thank heavens for Firefox.</p></div>

      <div class="entry-content"><p>Mr Tauron &#8211; thankyouverymuch!</p>
<p>I must admit I don&#8217;t spend an awful lot of time reading up on IE hacks &#8211; I make common use of <code>* html</code> for content masking, but little else. It&#8217;s a lot of effort to go to!</p>
<p>That hollyhack does seem pretty clean though, which seems good as far as I&#8217;m concerned! I&#8217;m planning to bump ResinTheBand onto a b2Evolution powered <span class="caps">CMS</span> sometime soon so I may well experiment with that hack in the near future. Thank you.</p></div>
