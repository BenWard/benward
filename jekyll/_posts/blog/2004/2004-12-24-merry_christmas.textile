Wishing you well and that you may indulge the Christmas spirit (of your choice) in a way that doesn't get you hurt.

I'll be enjoying 10 days back home with my family and driving down to see <a href="http://studentssocial.ben-ward.co.uk/modules.php?name=Journal&amp;file=display&amp;jid=65" title="Jo">Jo</a> in the afternoon. I hope everyone reading this has a similarly nice time.

Ben
