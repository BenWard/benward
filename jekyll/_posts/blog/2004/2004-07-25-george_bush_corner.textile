While forever far from being the man's greatest admirer, 4 years in GWB has still not lost his quotability.

<blockquote>"I have long expressed my concerns about Iran. After all, it is a totalitarian society where free people are not allowed to exercise their rights as human beings."</blockquote>

This is of course blatent hyprocrisy in the <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/" title="Michael Moore.com">Michael Moore</a> school of thought, and trigger happiness in everyone elses.

I do find it rather concerning that mere months from a presidential election, GWB thinks that talk of <em>more</em> wars is a good idea.
