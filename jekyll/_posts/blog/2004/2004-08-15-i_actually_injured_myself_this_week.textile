For ages I've been a total, complete and utter wuss. It's a well known and rarely denied fact about me.

However, having finally forced myself down to the gym (FSC company perk, yay!) I felt a little worn out (normal, I'd have thought) and then had a pretty ordinary Friday. Fine, no wussiness so far. However, on Saturday I woke up and my lower-right arm refused to move any high than my own shoulder. I could make a right angle with my upper-lower arm at best.

This isn't normal for me, I don't normally get <i>actually</i> injured when doing things. This time, however, I spent the whole of Saturday with my dominant arm crippled. It couldn't reach my mouth to eat, or brush my teeth (left-handed teeth brushing is rather awkward to say the least).

Anyway, it's just about fixed now (bar a few painful jars when stretching), so you can consider this my final "whinge to the world" on the matter. Sorry.
