<hr>

<p>I graduated in Computation at the <a href="http://manchester.ac.uk">University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology</a> and I've been doing things with the internet for over a decade. As well as writing software, I've served as an admin and maintainer at <a href="http://microformats.org">microformats.org</a>. Periodically I also write for various online publications as well as here.</p>

<p>For a more thorough professional summary, see my <a class="url" href="/cv" title="Ben Ward’s CV" rel="me">curriculum vitæ</a>.</p>

<h2>Elsewhere</h2>

<p>While the internet is wonderfully decentralised, I'm usually identifiable with the handle <samp class="nickname">benward</samp>, or sometimes <samp class="nickname">bnwrd</samp>. I keep a <a rel="me" href="/network">a list of my profiles on various sites</a>.</p>

<h2>This site</h2>

<p>This site is maintained and hosted by myself, with help from the excellent, lightweight Ruby CMS <a href="jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It's a stock install, with various hacks and additions. You can learn about how it works by looking at the <a href="https://github.com/benward/benward">source code on Github</a>.

<h2>Disambiguation</h2>
