<p>I'm <a class="fn n url" href="http://benward.me" rel="me"><span class="given-name nickname">Ben</span> <span class="additional-name">Michael</span> <span class="family-name">Ward</span></a> (born <time class="bday" datetime="1984-02-09">February 1984</time>), a <span class="title">software engineer</span> and web developer from Cambridge, UK. I graduated in Computation at the <a href="http://manchester.ac.uk">University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology</a> and am currently employed by Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com" class="org">Twitter</a>, in <span class="adr"><span class="locality">San Francisco</span></span>.</p>

<p>I've been doing things with the internet for over a decade, and as well as writing software have also written for various online publications.</p>

<p>My earliest memory is aged three, laying length-ways along a flight of stairs and attempting to roll down them one at a time. My earliest missing memory is what happened next.</p>

<p>For a more thorough professional summary, can read my <a class="url" href="/cv" title="Ben Ward’s CV" rel="me">curriculum vitæ</a>.</p>

<h2>Elsewhere</h2>

<p>The internet is wonderfully decentralised. I'm usually identifiable with the handle <samp class="nickname">benward</samp>, or sometimes <samp class="nickname">bnwrd</samp>. I'm most active on these sites:</p>

<h2>Disambiguation</h2>

<p>Inconveniently, there are other Ben Wards. Since my site tends to accrue better search engine rankings than others, here follows a handy list of other Ben Ward's I've stumbled upon that you may be looking for:</p>

<h2>This site</h2>

<p>This site is maintained and hosted by myself, with help from the very lightweight <a href="jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> CMS. It's a stock install, with various hacks and additions. You can learn about how it works by looking at the <a href="https://github.com/benward/benward">source code on Github</a>.

<p>I believe that you, the person reading or listening to this, should be able to resize it, re-colour it, rearrange it and mess with it to your personal satisfaction using whatever client-side technology is available to you. The ‘pixel perfect internet’ does not and shan't ever exist, so we shouldn't try to fake it.</p>
